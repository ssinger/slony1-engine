The 1.1.1 release primarily addresses four issues:

1.  A bug was discovered with the handling of multibyte (e.g. -
UNICODE, Big5) fields that led to columns sometimes being truncated on
subscriber nodes.

2.  Log shipping has, added to it, a SYNC timestamp, indicating the
time that each SYNC was applied on the origin node.

3.  COPY statements have field names added to them.  This allows data
to be copied into databases where tables might be augmented to have
additional columns not found on the master.

4.  It has been discovered that it is commonly VERY valuable to have
an index on sl_log_1(log_xid); this is now added, by default.

[Aside: Items 2 and 3 provide a little bit of vital data supporting
the use of log shipping to generate temporal databases...]

In addition, several low-complexity bugs have been addressed
including:

- An altperl Makefile error where "make" would try to build these
tools even if Perl was not present

- A Darwin DLL configuration error

- Some revisions to RPM spec files

- Bug 1362 - Verify that the provider is either the origin or an active subscriber

- Default logging level for slon has changed from 4 (which is a bit too verbose!) to 1.

- slonik immediately aborts if it cannot open the requested script file

- several fixes to the way the altperl tools start the slon process

- fixed some internal naming for altperl scripts

Some documentation enhancements have also been included which
obviously do not change the functionality of the software.

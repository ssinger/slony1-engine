<indexterm><primary>trigger handling</primary></indexterm>

<para> &slony1; has had two <quote>flavours</quote> of trigger
handling:</para>
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> In versions up to 1.2, &postgres; had no awareness of
replication, with the result that &slony1; needed to
<quote>hack</quote> on the system catalog in order to deactivate, on
subscribers, triggers that ought not to run.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para> This has had a number of somewhat painful side-effects including:</para> 
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> Corruption of the system catalog on subscribers, as
existing triggers, that generally need to be hidden, are
<quote>hacked</quote>, via <envar>pg_catalog.pg_trigger</envar>, to
point to the index being used by &slony1; as its <quote>primary
key</quote>.</para>

<para> The very same thing was true for rules. </para>

<para> This had the side-effect that
<application>pg_dump</application> could not be used to pull proper
schemas from subscriber nodes.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> It introduced the need to take out exclusive locks on
<emphasis>all replicated tables</emphasis> when processing
&rddlchanges; as triggers on each replicated table would need to be
dropped and re-added during the course of
processing.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> In &postgres; version 8.3, there is new functionality
where triggers and rules can have their behaviour altered via
<command>ALTER TABLE</command>, and specify any of the following
further trigger-related options:</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> <command> DISABLE TRIGGER trigger_name</command>  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <command> ENABLE TRIGGER trigger_name</command>  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <command> ENABLE REPLICA TRIGGER trigger_name</command>  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <command> ENABLE ALWAYS TRIGGER trigger_name</command>  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <command> DISABLE RULE rewrite_rule_name</command>  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <command> ENABLE RULE rewrite_rule_name</command>  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <command> ENABLE REPLICA RULE rewrite_rule_name</command>  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <command> ENABLE ALWAYS RULE rewrite_rule_name</command>  </para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para> A new GUC variable, <envar>session_replication_role</envar>
controls whether the session is in origin, replica, or local mode,
which then, in combination with the above enabling/disabling options,
controls whether or not the trigger function actually runs. </para>

<para> We may characterize when triggers fire, under &slony1;
replication, based on the following table; the same rules apply to
&postgres; rules.</para>

<para> There are, correspondingly, now, several ways in which &slony1;
interacts with this.  Let us outline those times that are interesting:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> Before replication is set up,
<emphasis>every</emphasis> database starts out in
<quote>origin</quote> status, and, by default, all triggers are of the
<command>ENABLE TRIGGER</command> form, so they all run, as is normal
in a system uninvolved in replication. </para> </listitem>

<listitem><para> When a &slony1; subscription is set up, on the origin
node, both the <function>logtrigger</function> and
<function>denyaccess</function> triggers are added, the former being
enabled, and running, the latter being disabled, so it does not
run. </para>

<para> From a locking perspective, each <xref
linkend="stmtsetaddtable"> request will need to briefly take out an
exclusive lock on each table as it attaches these triggers, which is
much the same as has always been the case with &slony1;. </para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> On the subscriber, the subscription process will add
the same triggers, but with the polarities <quote>reversed</quote>, to
protect data from accidental corruption on subscribers.  </para>

<para> From a locking perspective, again, there is not much difference
from earlier &slony1; behaviour, as the subscription process, due to
running <command>TRUNCATE</command>, copying data, and altering table
schemas, requires <emphasis>extensive</emphasis> exclusive table
locks, and the changes in trigger behaviour do not change those
requirements.  </para>

<para> However, note that the ability to enable and disable triggers
in a &postgres;-supported fashion means that we have had no need to
<quote>corrupt</quote> the system catalog, so we have the considerable
advantage that <application>pg_dump</application> may be used to draw
a completely consistent backup against any node in a &slony1;
cluster.</para>

</listitem>

<listitem><para>If you restore a backup of a Slony-I node (taken by pg_dump or 
any other method), and drop the Slony-I namespace, this now cleanly removes 
all Slony-I components, leaving the database, including its schema, 
in a <quote>pristine</quote>, consistent fashion, ready for whatever use may 
be desired. 
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> &rddlchanges; is now performed in quite a different
way: rather than altering each replicated table to <quote>take it out
of replicated mode</quote>, &slony1; instead simply shifts into the
<command>local</command> status for the duration of this event.  </para>

<para> On the origin, this deactivates the
<function>logtrigger</function> trigger. </para>

<para> On each subscriber, this deactivates the
<function>denyaccess</function> trigger. </para>

<para> This may be expected to allow DDL changes to become
<emphasis>enormously</emphasis> less expensive, since, rather than
needing to take out exclusive locks on <emphasis>all</emphasis>
replicated tables (as used to be mandated by the action of dropping
and adding back the &slony1;-created triggers), the only tables that
are locked are those ones that the DDL script was specifically acting
on.  </para>

</listitem>

<listitem><para> At the time of invoking <xref linkend="stmtmoveset">
against the former origin, &slony1; must transform that node into a
subscriber, which requires dropping the <function>lockset</function>
triggers, disabling the <function>logtrigger</function> triggers, and
enabling the <function>denyaccess</function> triggers. </para>

<para> At about the same time, when processing <xref
linkend="stmtmoveset"> against the new origin, &slony1; must transform
that node into an origin, which requires disabling the formerly active
<function>denyaccess</function> triggers, and enabling the
<function>logtrigger</function> triggers. </para>

<para> From a locking perspective, this will not behave differently
from older versions of &slony1;; to disable and enable the respective
triggers requires taking out exclusive locks on all replicated
tables. </para>

</listitem>

<listitem><para> Similarly to <xref linkend="stmtmoveset">, <xref
linkend="stmtfailover"> transforms a subscriber node into an origin,
which requires disabling the formerly active
<function>denyaccess</function> triggers, and enabling the
<function>logtrigger</function> triggers.  The locking implications
are again, much the same, requiring an exclusive lock on each such
table.  </para> </listitem>

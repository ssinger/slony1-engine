<title>&slony1; Installation</title>

<para>Note for &windows; users: Unless you are planning on hacking the
&slony1; code, it is highly recommended that you download and install
a prebuilt binary distribution and jump straight to the configuration
section below.
</para>

<para>You should have obtained the &slony1; source from the previous
step. Unpack it.</para>

<screen>
gunzip slony.tar.gz;
tar xf slony.tar
</screen>

<para> This will create a directory under the current directory with
the &slony1; sources.  Head into that that directory for the rest of
the installation procedure.</para>

<title>Configuration</title>

<para>The first step of the installation procedure is to configure the
source tree for your system.  This is done by running the
<application>configure</application> script.  In early versions,
<application>configure</application> needed to know where your
&postgres; source tree is, which was done with the
<option>--with-pgsourcetree=</option> option.  As of version 1.1, this
is no longer necessary, as &slony1; has included within its own code
base certain parts needed for platform portability.  It now only needs
to make reference to parts of &postgres; that are actually part of the
installation.  Therefore, &slony1; is configured by pointing it to the
various library, binary, and include directories.  For a full list of
these options, use the command <command>./configure --help</command>
</para>

<para>The <application>configure</application> script will run a
number of tests to guess values for various dependent variables and
try to detect some quirks of your system.  &slony1; is known to need a
modified version of <application>libpq</application> on specific
platforms such as Solaris2.X on SPARC.  The patch for libpq version
7.4.2 can be found at <ulink id="threadpatch" url=
"http://developer.postgresql.org/~wieck/slony1/download/threadsafe-libpq-742.diff.gz">
http://developer.postgresql.org/~wieck/slony1/download/threadsafe-libpq-742.diff.gz
</ulink> Similar patches may need to be constructed for other
versions; see the FAQ entry on <link linkend="threadsafety"> thread
safety </link>. </para>

<title>Build</title>

<para>To start the build process, type

<screen>
gmake all
</screen></para>

<para> Be sure to use GNU make; on BSD systems, it is called
<application>gmake</application>; on Linux, GNU make is typically the
<quote>native</quote> <application>make</application>, so the name of
the command you type in may be either <command>make</command> or
<command>gmake</command>.  On other platforms, you may need additional
packages or even install GNU make from scratch.  The build may take
anywhere from a few seconds to 2 minutes depending on how fast your
hardware is at compiling things.  The last line displayed should
be</para>

<para> <command> All of Slony-I is successfully made.  Ready to
install.  </command></para>

<sect2>
<title> Installing &slony1;</title>

<para> To install &slony1;, enter

<command>
gmake install
</command></para>

<para>This will install files into the postgresql install directory as
specified by the <command>configure</command>
<option>--prefix</option> option used in the &postgres; installation.
Make sure you have appropriate permissions to write into that area.
Commonly you need to do this either as root or as the postgres user.

<title> Installing &slony1; from RPMs</title>

<para> Even though &slony1; can be compiled and run on most Linux
distributions, it is also possible to install &slony1; using binary
packages. Slony Global Development Team provides official RPMs and
SRPMs for many versions or Red Hat ana Fedora Core.</para>

<para>The RPMs are available at <ulink
url="http://pgfoundry.org/projects/slony1/"> &slony1; at pgFoundry.org
</ulink>. Please read <command> CURRENT_MAINTAINER</command> file for
the details of the RPMs. Please note that the RPMs will look for RPM
installation of &postgres;, so if you install &postgres; from source,
you should manually ignore the RPM dependencies related to
&postgres;.</para>

<para>Installing &slony1; using these RPMs is as easy as 
installing any RPM.</para>

<screen>rpm -ivh postgresql-slony1-engine-....rpm</screen>

<para>If you want to upgrade the previous version, just use 
<command>rpm -Uvh</command> to upgrade it. But please remember to follow 
the usual upgrade procedure, too.</para>

<para>The RPM installs the files into their usual places. The
configuration files are installed under <filename>/etc</filename>, the
binary files are installed in <filename>/usr/bin</filename>, libraries
are installed in <filename>/usr/lib/pgsql</filename>, and finally the
docs are installed in
<filename>/usr/share/doc/postgresql-slony1-engine</filename>.</para>

<sect2>
<title> Installing the &slony1; service on &windows;</title>

<para> On &windows; systems, instead of running one <xref
linkend="slon"> daemon per node, a single slon service is installed
which can then be controlled through the <command>Services</command>
control panel applet, or from a command prompt using the
<command>net</command> command.</para>

<screen>
C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\8.0\bin> slon -regservice my_slon
Service registered.
Before you can run Slony, you must also register an engine!

WARNING! Service is registered to run as Local System. You are
encouraged to change this to a low privilege account to increase
system security. 
</screen>

<para> Once the service is installed, individual nodes can be setup
by registering slon configuration files with the service.</para>

<screen>
C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\8.0\bin> slon -addengine c:\node1.conf
Engine added.
</screen>

<para>Other, self explanatory commands include <command>slon -unregservice 
&lt;service name&gt;</command>, <command>slon -listengines 
&lt;service name&gt;</command> and <command>slon -delengine 
&lt;service name&gt; &lt;config file&gt;</command>.</para>

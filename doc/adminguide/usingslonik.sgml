<indexterm><primary>using slonik</primary></indexterm>

<para> It's a bit of a pain writing <application>Slonik</application>
scripts by hand, particularly as you start working with &slony1;
clusters that may be comprised of increasing numbers of nodes and
sets.  Some problems that have been noticed include the following:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> If you are using &slony1; as a
<quote>master/slave</quote> replication system with one
<quote>master</quote> node and one <quote>slave</quote> node, it may
be sufficiently mnemonic to call the <quote>master</quote> node 1 and
the <quote>slave</quote> node 2.</para>

<para> Unfortunately, as the number of nodes increases, the mapping of
IDs to nodes becomes way less obvious, particularly if you have a
cluster where the origin might shift from node to node over
time.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Similarly, if there is only one replication set, it's
fine for that to be <quote>set 1,</quote> but if there are a
multiplicity of sets, the numbering involved in using set numbers may
grow decreasingly intuitive.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> People have observed that
<application>Slonik</application> does not provide any notion of
iteration.  It is common to want to create a set of similar <xref
linkend="stmtstorepath"> entries, since, in most cases, hosts will
likely access a particular server via the same host name or IP
address.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Users seem interested in wrapping everything possible
in <command>TRY</command> blocks, which is regrettably somewhat
<emphasis>less</emphasis> useful than might be
hoped...</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>

<para> These have assortedly pointed to requests for such enhancements
as:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> Named nodes, named sets</para>

<para> This is supported in &slony1; 1.1 by the <xref
linkend="stmtdefine"> and <xref linkend="stmtinclude"> statements.
</para>

<para> The use of <xref linkend="stmtinclude"> to allow creating
<quote>preamble files</quote> has proven an invaluable tool to reduce
errors.  The preamble file is set up <emphasis>once</emphasis>,
verified <emphasis>once</emphasis>, and then that verified script may
be used with confidence for each slonik script.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> Looping and control constructs</para>

<para> It seems to make little sense to create a fullscale parser as
Yet Another Little Language grows into a rather larger one.  There are
plenty of scripting languages out there that can be used to construct
Slonik scripts; it is unattractive to force yet another one on people.
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>

<para> There are several ways to work around these issues that have
been seen <quote>in the wild</quote>:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> Embedding generation of slonik inside shell
scripts</para>

<para> The test bed found in the <filename>src/ducttape</filename>
directory takes this approach.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> The <link linkend="altperl"> altperl tools </link>
use Perl code to generate Slonik scripts.</para>

<para> You define the cluster's configuration as a set of Perl
objects; each script walks through the Perl objects as needed to
generate a slonik script for that script's purpose.
</para></listitem>

<sect1 id="slonikshell"><title> Embedding Slonik in Shell Scripts </title>

<indexterm><primary> embedding slonik in shell scripts </primary></indexterm>

<para> As mentioned earlier, there are numerous &slony1; test scripts
in <filename>src/ducttape</filename> that embed the generation of
Slonik inside the shell script.</para>

<para> They mostly <emphasis> don't </emphasis> do this in a terribly
sophisticated way.  Typically, they use the following sort of
structure:

<programlisting>
DB1=slony_test1
DB2=slony_test2
slonik <<_EOF_
	cluster name = T1;
	node 1 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$DB1';
	node 2 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$DB2';

	try {
		create set (id = 1, origin = 1, comment = 
                            'Set 1 - pgbench tables');
		set add table (set id = 1, origin = 1,
			id = 1, fully qualified name = 'public.accounts',
			comment = 'Table accounts');
		set add table (set id = 1, origin = 1,
			id = 2, fully qualified name = 'public.branches',
			comment = 'Table branches');
		set add table (set id = 1, origin = 1,
			id = 3, fully qualified name = 'public.tellers',
			comment = 'Table tellers');
		set add table (set id = 1, origin = 1,
			id = 4, fully qualified name = 'public.history',
			comment = 'Table accounts');
	}
	on error {
		exit 1;
	}
_EOF_
</programlisting></para>

<para> A more sophisticated approach might involve defining some
common components, notably the <quote>preamble</quote> that consists
of the <xref linkend="clustername"> <xref linkend="admconninfo">
commands that are common to every Slonik script, thus:

<programlisting>
CLUSTER=T1
DB1=slony_test1
DB2=slony_test2
PREAMBLE="cluster name = $CLUSTER
node 1 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$DB1';
node 2 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$DB2';
"
</programlisting></para>

<para> The <envar>PREAMBLE</envar> value could then be reused over and
over again if the shell script invokes <command>slonik</command>
multiple times.  You might also consider using <xref
     linkend="stmtinclude"> and place the preamble in a file that is
<command>include</command>d.
 </para>

<para> Shell variables provide a simple way to assign names to sets
and nodes:

<programlisting>
origin=1
subscriber=2
mainset=1
slonik <<_EOF_
$PREAMBLE
try {
	create set (id = $mainset, origin = $origin, 
                    comment = 'Set $mainset - pgbench tables');
	set add table (set id = $mainset, origin = $origin,
		id = 1, fully qualified name = 'public.accounts',
		comment = 'Table accounts');
	set add table (set id = $mainset, origin = $origin,
		id = 2, fully qualified name = 'public.branches',
		comment = 'Table branches');
	set add table (set id = $mainset, origin = $origin,
		id = 3, fully qualified name = 'public.tellers',
		comment = 'Table tellers');
	set add table (set id = $mainset, origin = $origin,
		id = 4, fully qualified name = 'public.history',
		comment = 'Table accounts');
} on error {
	exit 1;
}
_EOF_
</programlisting></para>

<para> The script might be further enhanced to loop through the list
of tables as follows:

<programlisting>
# Basic configuration
origin=1
subscriber=2
mainset=1
# List of tables to replicate
TABLES="accounts branches tellers history"
ADDTABLES=""
tnum=1
for table in `echo $TABLES`; do
  ADDTABLES="$ADDTABLES
   set add table ($set id = $mainset, origin = $origin,
   id = $tnum, fully qualified name = 'public.$table',
   comment = 'Table $tname');
"
  let "tnum=tnum+1"
done
slonik <<_EOF_
$PREAMBLE
try {
	create set (id = $mainset, origin = $origin, 
                    comment = 'Set $mainset - pgbench tables');
$ADDTABLES
} on error {
	exit 1;
}
_EOF_
</programlisting></para>

<para> That is of somewhat dubious value if you only have 4 tables,
but eliminating errors resulting from enumerating large lists of
configuration by hand will make this pretty valuable for the larger
examples you'll find in <quote>real life.</quote></para>

<para> You can do even more sophisticated things than this if your
scripting language supports things like:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> <quote>Record</quote> data structures that allow
assigning things in parallel</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Functions, procedures, or subroutines, allowing you
to implement useful functionality once, and then refer to it multiple
times within a script</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Some sort of <quote>module import</quote> system so
that common functionality can be shared across many
scripts</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>

<para> If you can depend on having <ulink
url="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html"> Bash</ulink>, <ulink
url="http://www.zsh.org/"> zsh</ulink>, or <ulink
url="http://www.kornshell.com/"> Korn shell</ulink> available, well,
those are all shells with extensions supporting reasonably
sophisticated data structures and module systems.  On Linux, Bash is
fairly ubiquitous; on commercial <trademark>UNIX</trademark>, Korn
shell is fairly ubiquitous; on BSD, <quote>sophisticated</quote>
shells are an option rather than a default.</para>

<para> At that point, it makes sense to start looking at other
scripting languages, of which Perl is the most ubiquitous, being
widely available on Linux, <trademark>UNIX</trademark>, and BSD.

<sect1 id="noslonik"><title> Not Using Slonik - Bare Metal &slony1;
Functions </title>

<indexterm><primary> bare metal &slony1; functions </primary></indexterm>

<para> There are cases where it may make sense to directly use the
stored functions that implement the various pieces of &slony1;.
Slonik doesn't do terribly much <quote>magic;</quote> it is common for
Slonik commands to simply involve deciding on a node at which to apply
a command, and then submit a SQL query consisting of a call to one of
the &slony1; stored functions.</para>

<para> The developers of &slony1; anticipate that interested parties
may wish to develop graphical tools as an alternative to Slonik; it
would be entirely appropriate in such cases to submit configuration
requests directly via the stored functions.  If you plan to do so, it
is suggested that you examine how the stored procedures are used in
<filename>slonik.c</filename>, as that represents the most correct use
of the functions.</para>

<para> When debugging problems in <quote>troubled</quote> &slony1;
clusters, it has also occasionally proven useful to use the stored
functions.  This has been particularly useful for cases where <xref
linkend="table.sl-listen"> configuration has been broken, and events
have not been propagating properly.  The <quote>easiest</quote> fix
was to:</para>

<para> <command> select
_slonycluster.droplisten(li_origin,li_provider,li_receiver) from
_slonycluster.sl_listen;</command></para>

<para> <command> select _slonycluster.storelisten(pa_server,
pa_server, pa_client) from _slonycluster.sl_path;</command></para>

<para> The result of this set of queries is to regenerate
<emphasis>and propagate</emphasis> the listen paths.  By running the main
<function> _slonycluster.storelisten()</function> function,
<command>STORE_LISTEN</command> events are raised to cause the listen paths to
propagate to the other nodes in the cluster.</para>

<para> If there was a <emphasis>local</emphasis> problem on one node, and you
didn't want the updates to propagate (this would be an unusual
situation; you almost certainly want to fix things
<emphasis>everywhere</emphasis>), the queries would instead be:</para>

<para> <command> select
slonycluster.droplisten_int(li_origin,li_provider,li_receiver) from
_slonycluster.sl_listen;</command></para>

<para> <command> select _slonycluster.storelisten_int(pa_server,
pa_server, pa_client) from _slonycluster.sl_path;</command></para>

<para> If you are planning to add &slony1; support to other tools
(<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis> - adding replication support to something
like <ulink url="http://www.pgadmin.org/"> <productname>pgAdmin
III</productname> </ulink>), you need to be clear on where various
functions need to be called.  The normal <quote>protocol</quote> is
thus:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> The <quote>main</quote> function
(<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis> - without the <command>_int</command>
suffix) is called on a <quote>relevant</quote> node in the &slony1;
cluster.</para>

<para> In some cases, the function may be called on any node, and it
can satisfactorily propagate to other nodes.  That is true for <xref
linkend="function.storelisten-integer-integer-integer">, for instance.
In other cases, the function needs to be called on some particular
node because that is the only place where data may be reasonably
validated.  For instance, <xref
linkend="function.subscribeset-integer-integer-integer-boolean-boolean"> must
be called on the receivernode.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> If that <quote>main</quote> function succeeds, then
the configuration change is performed on the local node, and an event
is created using <xref linkend="function.createevent-name-text"> to
cause the configuration change to propagate to all of the other nodes
in the &slony1; cluster.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Thirdly, the <command>_int</command> version of the
function must be run.</para>  

<para> In some cases, where functions are idempotent, the node where
the <quote>main</quote> function runs can do this fairly early in
processing.</para>

<para> When the event propagates, the other nodes will run the
<command>_int</command> version, we rather hope with good
success. </para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>

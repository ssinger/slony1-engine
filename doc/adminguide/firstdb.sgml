<sect1 id="firstdb"><title>Replicating Your First Database</title>

<indexterm><primary>replicating your first database</primary></indexterm>

<para>In this example, we will be replicating a brand new
<application>pgbench</application> database.  The mechanics of
replicating an existing database are covered here, however we
recommend that you learn how &slony1; functions by using a fresh new
non-production database.</para>

<para> Note that <application>pgbench</application> is a
<quote>benchmark</quote> tool that is in the &postgres; set of
<filename>contrib</filename> tools. If you build &postgres; from
source, you can readily head to <filename>contrib/pgbench</filename>
and do a <command>make install</command> to build and install it; you
may discover that included in packaged binary &postgres;
installations.</para>

<para>The &slony1; replication engine is trigger-based, allowing us to
replicate databases (or portions thereof) running under the same
postmaster.</para>

<para>This example will show how to replicate the
<application>pgbench</application> database running on localhost
(master) to the <application>pgbench</application> slave database also running on localhost
(slave).  We make a couple of assumptions about your &postgres;
configuration:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> You have <option>tcpip_socket=true</option> in your
<filename>postgresql.conf</filename>;</para> <note> <para> This is no longer needed for &postgres; 8.0 and later versions.</para></note> </listitem>

<listitem><para> You have enabled access in your cluster(s) via
<filename>pg_hba.conf</filename></para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>

<para> The <envar>REPLICATIONUSER</envar> needs to be a &postgres;
superuser.  This is typically postgres or pgsql, although in complex
environments it is quite likely a good idea to define a
<command>slony</command> user to distinguish between the roles.</para>

<para>You should also set the following shell variables:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> <envar>CLUSTERNAME</envar>=slony_example</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <envar>MASTERDBNAME</envar>=pgbench</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <envar>SLAVEDBNAME</envar>=pgbenchslave</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <envar>MASTERHOST</envar>=localhost</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <envar>SLAVEHOST</envar>=localhost</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <envar>REPLICATIONUSER</envar>=pgsql</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <envar>PGBENCHUSER</envar>=pgbench</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>Here are a couple of examples for setting variables in common shells:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
  <para>bash, sh, ksh
  <command>export CLUSTERNAME=slony_example</command></para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>(t)csh:
  <command>setenv CLUSTERNAME slony_example</command></para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para><warning><para> If you're changing these variables to use
different hosts for <envar>MASTERHOST</envar> and <envar>SLAVEHOST</envar>, be sure
<emphasis>not</emphasis> to use localhost for either of them.  This will result
in an error similar to the following:</para>

<para><command>
ERROR  remoteListenThread_1: db_getLocalNodeId() returned 2 - wrong database?
</command></para>
</warning></para>


<sect2><title>Creating the <application>pgbench</application> user</title>

<para><command>
createuser -A -D $PGBENCHUSER
</command>
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2><title>Preparing the databases</title>

<programlisting>
createdb -O $PGBENCHUSER -h $MASTERHOST $MASTERDBNAME
createdb -O $PGBENCHUSER -h $SLAVEHOST $SLAVEDBNAME
pgbench -i -s 1 -U $PGBENCHUSER -h $MASTERHOST $MASTERDBNAME
</programlisting>

<para> One of the tables created by
<application>pgbench</application>, <envar>history</envar>, does not
have a primary key.  In earlier versions of &slony1;, a &lslonik;
command called <xref linkend="stmttableaddkey"> could be used to
introduce one.  This caused a number of problems, and so this feature
has been removed in version 2 of &slony1;.  It now
<emphasis>requires</emphasis> that there is a suitable candidate
primary key. </para>

<para> The following SQL requests will establish a proper primary key on this table: </para>

<programlisting>
psql -U $PGBENCHUSER -h $HOST1 -d $MASTERDBNAME -c "begin; alter table
history add column id serial; update history set id =
nextval('history_id_seq'); alter table history add primary key(id);
commit"
</programlisting>

<para>Because &slony1; depends on the databases having the pl/pgSQL
procedural language installed, we better install it now.  It is
possible that you have installed pl/pgSQL into the template1 database
in which case you can skip this step because it's already installed
into the <envar>$MASTERDBNAME</envar>.

<programlisting>
createlang -h $MASTERHOST plpgsql $MASTERDBNAME
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>&slony1; does not automatically copy table definitions from a
master when a slave subscribes to it, so we need to import this data.
We do this with <application>pg_dump</application>.

<programlisting>
pg_dump -s -U $REPLICATIONUSER -h $MASTERHOST $MASTERDBNAME | psql -U $REPLICATIONUSER -h $SLAVEHOST $SLAVEDBNAME
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>To illustrate how &slony1; allows for on the fly replication
subscription, let's start up <application>pgbench</application>.  If
you run the <application>pgbench</application> application in the
foreground of a separate terminal window, you can stop and restart it
with different parameters at any time.  You'll need to re-export the
variables again so they are available in this session as well.
</para>

<para>The typical command to run <application>pgbench</application> would look like:

<programlisting>
pgbench -s 1 -c 5 -t 1000 -U $PGBENCHUSER -h $MASTERHOST $MASTERDBNAME
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>This will run <application>pgbench</application> with 5 concurrent clients
each processing 1000 transactions against the <application>pgbench</application>
database running on localhost as the pgbench user.
</para></sect2>

<sect2><title>Configuring the Database for Replication.</title>

<para>Creating the configuration tables, stored procedures, triggers
and configuration is all done through the <xref linkend="slonik">
tool. It is a specialized scripting aid that mostly calls stored
procedures in the master/slave (node) databases. </para>

<para> The example that follows uses <xref linkend="slonik"> directly
(or embedded directly into scripts).  This is not necessarily the most
pleasant way to get started; there exist tools for building <xref
linkend="slonik"> scripts under the <filename>tools</filename>
directory, including:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> <xref linkend="altperl"> - a set of Perl scripts that
build <xref linkend="slonik"> scripts based on a single
<filename>slon_tools.conf</filename> file. </para> </listitem>

<listitem><para> <xref linkend="mkslonconf"> - a shell script
(<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis> - works with Bash) which, based either on
self-contained configuration or on shell environment variables,
generates a set of <xref linkend="slonik"> scripts to configure a
whole cluster. </para> </listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<sect3><title>Using slonik command directly</title>

<para>The traditional approach to administering slony is to craft
slonik commands directly. An example of this given here. </para>

<para> The script to create
the initial configuration for the simple master-slave setup of our
<application>pgbench</application> database looks like this:</para>

<programlisting>
#!/bin/sh

slonik <<_EOF_
	#--
	# define the namespace the replication system uses in our example it is
	# slony_example
	#--
	cluster name = $CLUSTERNAME;

	#--
	# admin conninfo's are used by slonik to connect to the nodes one for each
	# node on each side of the cluster, the syntax is that of PQconnectdb in
	# the C-API
	# --
	node 1 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$MASTERDBNAME host=$MASTERHOST user=$REPLICATIONUSER';
	node 2 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$SLAVEDBNAME host=$SLAVEHOST user=$REPLICATIONUSER';

	#--
	# init the first node.  Its id MUST be 1.  This creates the schema
	# _$CLUSTERNAME containing all replication system specific database
	# objects.

	#--
	init cluster ( id=1, comment = 'Master Node');
 
	#--
	# Slony-I organizes tables into sets.  The smallest unit a node can
	# subscribe is a set.  The following commands create one set containing
	# all 4 pgbench tables.  The master or origin of the set is node 1.
	#--
	create set (id=1, origin=1, comment='All pgbench tables');
	set add table (set id=1, origin=1, id=1, fully qualified name = 'public.accounts', comment='accounts table');
	set add table (set id=1, origin=1, id=2, fully qualified name = 'public.branches', comment='branches table');
	set add table (set id=1, origin=1, id=3, fully qualified name = 'public.tellers', comment='tellers table');
	set add table (set id=1, origin=1, id=4, fully qualified name = 'public.history', comment='history table');

	#--
	# Create the second node (the slave) tell the 2 nodes how to connect to
	# each other and how they should listen for events.
	#--

	store node (id=2, comment = 'Slave node', event node=1);
	store path (server = 1, client = 2, conninfo='dbname=$MASTERDBNAME host=$MASTERHOST user=$REPLICATIONUSER');
	store path (server = 2, client = 1, conninfo='dbname=$SLAVEDBNAME host=$SLAVEHOST user=$REPLICATIONUSER');
_EOF_
</programlisting>

<para>Is the <application>pgbench</application> still running?  If
not, then start it again.</para>

<para>At this point we have 2 databases that are fully prepared.  One
is the master database in which <application>pgbench</application> is
busy accessing and changing rows.  It's now time to start the
replication daemons.</para>

<para>On $MASTERHOST the command to start the replication engine is

<programlisting>
slon $CLUSTERNAME "dbname=$MASTERDBNAME user=$REPLICATIONUSER host=$MASTERHOST"
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Likewise we start the replication system on node 2 (the slave)

<programlisting>
slon $CLUSTERNAME "dbname=$SLAVEDBNAME user=$REPLICATIONUSER host=$SLAVEHOST"
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Even though we have the <xref linkend="slon"> running on both
the master and slave, and they are both spitting out diagnostics and
other messages, we aren't replicating any data yet.  The notices you
are seeing is the synchronization of cluster configurations between
the 2 <xref linkend="slon"> processes.</para>

<para>To start replicating the 4 <application>pgbench</application>
tables (set 1) from the master (node id 1) the the slave (node id 2),
execute the following script.

<programlisting>
#!/bin/sh
slonik <<_EOF_
	 # ----
	 # This defines which namespace the replication system uses
	 # ----
	 cluster name = $CLUSTERNAME;

	 # ----
	 # Admin conninfo's are used by the slonik program to connect
	 # to the node databases.  So these are the PQconnectdb arguments
	 # that connect from the administrators workstation (where
	 # slonik is executed).
	 # ----
	 node 1 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$MASTERDBNAME host=$MASTERHOST user=$REPLICATIONUSER';
	 node 2 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$SLAVEDBNAME host=$SLAVEHOST user=$REPLICATIONUSER';

	 # ----
	 # Node 2 subscribes set 1
	 # ----
	 subscribe set ( id = 1, provider = 1, receiver = 2, forward = no);
_EOF_
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>Any second now, the replication daemon on
<envar>$SLAVEHOST</envar> will start to copy the current content of
all 4 replicated tables.  While doing so, of course, the
<application>pgbench</application> application will continue to modify
the database.  When the copy process is finished, the replication
daemon on <envar>$SLAVEHOST</envar> will start to catch up by applying
the accumulated replication log.  It will do this in little steps,
initially doing about 10 seconds worth of application work at a time.
Depending on the performance of the two systems involved, the sizing
of the two databases, the actual transaction load and how well the two
databases are tuned and maintained, this catchup process may be a
matter of minutes, hours, or eons.</para>

<para> If you encounter problems getting this working, check over the
logs for the &lslon; processes, as error messages are likely to be
suggestive of the nature of the problem.  The tool &lteststate; is
also useful for diagnosing problems with nearly-functioning
replication clusters.</para>

<para>You have now successfully set up your first basic master/slave
replication system, and the 2 databases should, once the slave has
caught up, contain identical data.  That's the theory, at least.  In
practice, it's good to build confidence by verifying that the datasets
are in fact the same.</para>

<para>The following script will create ordered dumps of the 2
databases and compare them.  Make sure that
<application>pgbench</application> has completed, so that there are no
new updates hitting the origin node, and that your slon sessions have
caught up.</para>

<sect3><title>Using the altperl scripts</title>

<indexterm><primary> altperl script example </primary></indexterm>

<para>
Using the <xref linkend="altperl"> scripts is an alternative way to
get started; it allows you to avoid writing slonik scripts, at least
for some of the simple ways of configuring &slony1;.  The
<command>slonik_build_env</command> script will generate output
providing details you need to build a
<filename>slon_tools.conf</filename>, which is required by these
scripts.  An example <filename>slon_tools.conf</filename> is provided
in the distribution to get you started.  The altperl scripts all
reference this central configuration file centralize cluster
configuration information. Once slon_tools.conf has been created, you
can proceed as follows:
</para>

<programlisting>
# Initialize cluster:
$ slonik_init_cluster  | slonik 

# Start slon  (here 1 and 2 are node numbers)
$ slon_start 1    
$ slon_start 2

# Create Sets (here 1 is a set number)
$ slonik_create_set 1 | slonik             

# subscribe set to second node (1= set ID, 2= node ID)
$ slonik_subscribe_set 1 2 | slonik
</programlisting>

<para> You have now replicated your first database.  You can skip the
following section of documentation if you'd like, which documents more
of a <quote>bare-metal</quote> approach.</para>

<indexterm><primary>communication paths</primary></indexterm>

<para> &slony1; uses &postgres; DSNs in three contexts to establish
access to databases:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> <xref linkend="admconninfo"> - controlling how a
<xref linkend="slonik"> script accesses the various nodes.</para>

<para> These connections are the ones that go from your
<quote>administrative workstation</quote> to all of the nodes in a &slony1;
cluster.</para>

<para> It is <emphasis>vital</emphasis> that you have connections from the
central location where you run <xref linkend="slonik"> 
to each and every node in the network.  These connections are only
used briefly, to submit the few <acronym>SQL</acronym> requests required to
control the administration of the cluster.</para>

<para> Since these communications paths are only used briefly, it may
be quite reasonable to <quote>hack together</quote> temporary
connections using <link linkend="tunnelling">SSH
tunnelling</link>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> The &lslon; DSN parameter. </para>

<para> The DSN parameter passed to each &lslon; indicates what network
path should be used to get from the &lslon; process to the database
that it manages.</para> </listitem>

<listitem><para> <xref linkend="stmtstorepath"> - controlling how
&lslon; daemons communicate with remote nodes.  These paths are stored
in <xref linkend="table.sl-path">.</para>

<para> You forcibly <emphasis>need</emphasis> to have a path between
each subscriber node and its provider; other paths are optional, and
will not be used unless a listen path in <xref
linkend="table.sl-listen">. is needed that uses that particular
path.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>

<para> The distinctions and possible complexities of paths are not
normally an issue for people with simple networks where all the hosts
can see one another via a comparatively <quote>global</quote> set of
network addresses.  In contrast, it matters rather a lot for those
with complex firewall configurations, nodes at multiple locations, and
the issue where nodes may not be able to all talk to one another via a
uniform set of network addresses.</para>

<para> Consider the attached diagram, which describes a set of six
nodes

<inlinemediaobject> <imageobject> <imagedata fileref="complexenv.png">
</imageobject> <textobject> <phrase> Symmetric Multisites </phrase>
</textobject> </inlinemediaobject></para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> DB1 and DB2 are databases residing in a secure
<quote>database layer,</quote> firewalled against outside access
except from specifically controlled locations.</para>

<para> Let's suppose that DB1 is the origin node for the replication
system.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> DB3 resides in a <quote>DMZ</quote> at the same site;
it is intended to be used as a &slony1; <quote>provider</quote> for
remote locations.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> DB4 is a counterpart to DB3 in a <quote>DMZ</quote>
at a secondary/failover site.  Its job, in the present configuration,
is to <quote>feed</quote> servers in the secure database layers at the
secondary site.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> DB5 and DB6 are counterparts to DB1 and DB2, but
are, at present, configured as subscribers.</para>

<para> Supposing disaster were to strike at the <quote>primary</quote>
site, the secondary site would be well-equipped to take over servicing
the applications that use this data.</para>

<para> Managers paying bills are likely to be reluctant to let the
machines at the secondary site merely be <quote>backups;</quote> they
would doubtless prefer for them to be useful, and that can certainly
be the case.  If the primary site is being used for
<quote>transactional activities,</quote> the replicas at the secondary
site may be used for running time-oriented reports that do not require
up-to-the second data.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> The symmetry of the configuration means that if you
had <emphasis>two</emphasis> transactional applications needing
protection from failure, it would be straightforward to have
additional replication sets so that each site is normally
<quote>primary</quote> for one application, and where destruction of
one site could be addressed by consolidating services at the remaining
site.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para> There is also room for discussion of SSH tunnelling
here...</para>

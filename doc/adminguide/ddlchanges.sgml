</indexterm>

<para>When changes are made to the database schema,
<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis> - adding fields to a table, it is necessary
for this to be handled rather carefully, otherwise different nodes may
get rather deranged because they disagree on how particular tables are
built.</para>


<para>&slony1; can not automatically detect and replicate database schema
changes however, &slony1; does provide facilities to assist in making 
database schema changes.  Schema changes can be done on a replicated
database either by using the &slony1;  <xref
linkend="stmtddlscript"> (slonik) command or by manually applying the
changes to each node.</para>

<sect2>
<title>DDL Changes with Execute Script</title>
<para>
The <xref linkend="stmtddlscript"> (slonik) command allows you to submit
a SQL script (that can, but is not required to) contain DDL commands. 
This script will be executed on the event node and then (optionally) replicated
to every other node in the cluster.  You should keep the following in mind
when using <xref linkend="stmtddlscript">
<para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>The script <emphasis>must not</emphasis> contain
transaction <command>BEGIN</command> or <command>END</command>
statements, as the script is already executed inside a transaction
though nested transactions are allowed as long are processed
within the scope of a single transaction whose <command>BEGIN</command> 
and <command>END</command> you do not control.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If there is <emphasis>anything</emphasis> broken about
the script, or about how it executes on a particular node (other than
the event node), this will
cause the <xref linkend="slon"> daemon for that node to panic and crash.  
You may see various expected messages (positive and negative)
in <xref linkend="ddllogs">.  If you restart the slon, it will,
most likely, try to
<emphasis>repeat</emphasis> the DDL script, which will, almost
certainly, fail the second time in the same way it did the first time.
</para>

<para> The implication of this is that it is
<emphasis>vital</emphasis> that modifications not be made in a
haphazard way on one node or another.  The schemas must always stay in
sync.  If slon; fails due to a failed DDL change then
you should manually (via psql) make the required changes so that the
DDL change succeeds the next time slon attempts it.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>&slony1; 2.0.x and 2.1.x suffer from an issue where
concurrent transactions involving the same tables as are referenced
in the script might not be replayed in exactly the same order on the
replica nodes.  It is advisiable to not be concurrently inserting,deleting
or updating rows to a table while a script changing that table (adding or
deleting columns) is also running.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<title>Applying DDL Changes Directly</title>


<para>DDL changes can be applied directly on a node through an
application such as <command>psql</command>.  The DDL changes will not
be replicated by &slony1; and therefore must be manually applied to
every relevant node.  The following points should be kept in mind when
applying DDL changes directly.

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>While DDL changes are not automatically replicated,
any <command>INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE</command> statements that you
execute will be captured for replication, when run against the origin
node.  This means that you should not include DDL changes and DML
inside the same script when apply DDL directly, because the script
will not behave properly when you execute it on other nodes.</para>

<para> If you, instead, apply DDL using <command>EXECUTE
SCRIPT</command>, it is fine to intersperse DDL and DML within the
script, as &slony1; handles that appropriately.</para>

</listitem>

<listitem><para>You are responsible for ensuring that your scripts get
applied on all other nodes at the correct point in the replication
stream (<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis> - on or before the appropriate SYNC
event).  The best way of doing this with respect to adding and
deleting columns is to make sure that new columns always get added on
the replica nodes first and that columns being removed are dropped
from the master before they are dropped from the replicas.  That way,
new columns are always available on the subscriber on or before the
time they will be needed, and obsolete ones remain on the subscriber
until after the last possible reference to them has been
replicated.</para>

<warning><para> If columns being added or dropped are mandatory (NOT
NULL) or have default values, you will need to go through a longer
process to ensure constraints are satisfied at each point in time on
all nodes.</para>

<para> For instance, if dropping a column that has a NOT NULL
constraint, it may take multiple ALTER TABLE statements on each node
in order to successfully accomplish this, as the constraint needs to
be relaxed first.</para>

</warning></listitem>

<listitem><para>DDL changes that rename a replicated table do not
inform &slony1; of the new table name.  If you change then name of
a replicated table you must allow &slony1; to find the new table name
by calling <xref linkend="function.updaterelname-p-only-on-node-integer-p-set-id-integer">
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>DDL changes that alter either a primary key, a unique constraint
that slony is using, or DDL changes that drop columns that come before
the key or unique constraint that &slony1; is using will require
&slony1; too reconfigure the arguments on the logtrigger. The function
<xref linkend="function.repair-log-triggers-only-locked-boolean"> will
reconfigure the trigger arguments of any &slony1; log triggers that
are out of date.  If <option>true</option> is passed to this function
it will only adjust tables that are already locked by the current
transaction (if you perform your <command>alter table</command> within
a transaction and then call <function>repair_log_triggers()</function>
as part of the same transaction then the altered tables will be
locked).  If you pass <option>false</option> to this function then the
function will obtain an exclusive lock on any table that needs the
trigger to be reconfigured.

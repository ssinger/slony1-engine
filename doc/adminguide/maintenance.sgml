<sect1 id="maintenance"> <title>&slony1; Maintenance</title>

<indexterm><primary>maintaining &slony1;</primary></indexterm>

<para>&slony1; actually does a lot of its necessary maintenance
itself, in a <quote>cleanup</quote> thread:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> Deletes old data from various tables in the
<productname>Slony-I</productname> cluster's namespace, notably
entries in <xref linkend="table.sl-log-1">, <xref
linkend="table.sl-log-2"> (not yet used), and <xref
linkend="table.sl-seqlog">.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Vacuum certain tables used by &slony1;.  As of 1.0.5,
this includes &pglistener;; in earlier versions, you must vacuum that
table heavily, otherwise you'll find replication slowing down because
&slony1; raises plenty of events, which leads to that table having
plenty of dead tuples.</para>

<para> In some versions (1.1, for sure; possibly 1.0.5) there is the
option of not bothering to vacuum any of these tables if you are using
something like <application>pg_autovacuum</application> to handle
vacuuming of these tables.  Unfortunately, it has been quite possible
for <application>pg_autovacuum</application> to not vacuum quite
frequently enough, so you probably want to use the internal vacuums.
Vacuuming &pglistener; <quote>too often</quote> isn't nearly as
hazardous as not vacuuming it frequently enough.</para>

<para>Unfortunately, if you have long-running transactions, vacuums
cannot clear out dead tuples that are newer than the eldest
transaction that is still running.  This will most notably lead to
&pglistener; growing large and will slow
replication.</para></listitem>


<listitem> <para> The <link linkend="dupkey"> Duplicate Key Violation
</link> bug has helped track down some &postgres; race conditions.
One remaining issue is that it appears that is a case where
<command>VACUUM</command> is not reclaiming space correctly, leading
to corruption of B-trees. </para>

<para> It may be helpful to run the command <command> REINDEX TABLE
sl_log_1;</command> periodically to avoid the problem
occurring. </para> </listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>

<sect2><title> Watchdogs: Keeping Slons Running</title>

<indexterm><primary>watchdogs to keep slon daemons running</primary></indexterm>

<para>There are a couple of <quote>watchdog</quote> scripts available
that monitor things, and restart the <application>slon</application>
processes should they happen to die for some reason, such as a network
<quote>glitch</quote> that causes loss of connectivity.</para>

<para>You might want to run them...</para>

<para> The <quote>best new way</quote> of managing <xref
linkend="slon"> processes is via the combination of <xref
linkend="mkslonconf">, which creates a configuration file for each
node in a cluster, and <xref linkend="launchclusters">, which uses
those configuration files.</para>

<para> This approach is preferable to elder <quote>watchdog</quote>
systems in that you can very precisely <quote>nail down,</quote> in
each config file, the exact desired configuration for each node, and
not need to be concerned with what options the watchdog script may or
may not give you.  This is particularly important if you are using
<link linkend="logshipping"> log shipping </link>, where forgetting
the <command>-a</command> option could ruin your log shipped node, and
thereby your whole day.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>Parallel to Watchdog: generate_syncs.sh</title>

<para>A new script for &slony1; 1.1 is
<application>generate_syncs.sh</application>, which addresses the following kind of
situation.</para>

<para>Supposing you have some possibly-flakey server where the
<application>slon</application> daemon that might not run all the time, you might
return from a weekend away only to discover the following situation.</para>

<para>On Friday night, something went <quote>bump</quote> and while the
database came back up, none of the <application>slon</application> daemons
survived.  Your online application then saw nearly three days worth of
reasonably heavy transaction load.</para>

<para>When you restart <application>slon</application> on Monday, it
hasn't done a SYNC on the master since Friday, so that the next
<quote>SYNC set</quote> comprises all of the updates between Friday
and Monday.  Yuck.</para>

<para>If you run <application>generate_syncs.sh</application> as a cron job every
20 minutes, it will force in a periodic <command>SYNC</command> on the origin, which
means that between Friday and Monday, the numerous updates are split
into more than 100 syncs, which can be applied incrementally, making
the cleanup a lot less unpleasant.</para>

<para>Note that if <command>SYNC</command>s <emphasis>are</emphasis> running
regularly, this script won't bother doing anything.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Testing &slony1; State </title>

<indexterm><primary>testing cluster status</primary></indexterm>

<para> In the <filename>tools</filename> directory, you may find
scripts called <filename>test_slony_state.pl</filename> and
<filename>test_slony_state-dbi.pl</filename>.  One uses the Perl/DBI
interface; the other uses the Pg interface.
</para>

<para> Both do essentially the same thing, namely to connect to a
&slony1; node (you can pick any one), and from that, determine all the
nodes in the cluster.  They then run a series of queries (read only,
so this should be quite safe to run) which look at the various
&slony1; tables, looking for a variety of sorts of conditions
suggestive of problems, including:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> Bloating of tables like pg_listener, sl_log_1, sl_log_2, sl_seqlog </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> Listen paths </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> Analysis of Event propagation </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> Analysis of Event confirmation propagation </para> 

<para> If communications is a <emphasis>little</emphasis> broken,
replication may happen, but confirmations may not get back, which
prevents nodes from clearing out old events and old replication
data. </para> </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para> Running this once an hour or once a day can help you detect
symptoms of problems early, before they lead to performance
degradation. </para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Replication Test Scripts </title>

<para> In the directory <filename>tools</filename> may be found four
scripts that may be used to do monitoring of &slony1; instances:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> <command>test_slony_replication</command> is a
Perl script to which you can pass connection information to get to a
&slony1; node.  It then queries <xref linkend="table.sl-path"> and
other information on that node in order to determine the shape of the
requested replication set.</para>

<para> It then injects some test queries to a test table called
<envar>slony_test</envar> which is defined as follows, and which needs to be
added to the set of tables being replicated:

<programlisting>
CREATE TABLE slony_test (
    description text,
    mod_date timestamp with time zone,
    "_Slony-I_testcluster_rowID" bigint DEFAULT nextval('"_testcluster".sl_rowid_seq'::text) NOT NULL
);
</programlisting></para>

<para> The last column in that table was defined by &slony1; as one
lacking a primary key...</para>

<para> This script generates a line of output for each &slony1; node
that is active for the requested replication set in a file called
<filename>cluster.fact.log</filename>.</para>

<para> There is an additional <option>finalquery</option> option that allows
you to pass in an application-specific SQL query that can determine
something about the state of your application.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><command>log.pm</command> is a Perl module that manages logging
for the Perl scripts.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><command>run_rep_tests.sh</command> is a <quote>wrapper</quote> script
that runs <command>test_slony_replication</command>.</para>

<para> If you have several &slony1; clusters, you might set up
configuration in this file to connect to all those
clusters.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><command>nagios_slony_test</command> is a script that
was constructed to query the log files so that you might run the
replication tests every so often (we run them every 6 minutes), and
then a system monitoring tool such as <ulink
url="http://www.nagios.org/"> <productname>Nagios</productname>
</ulink> can be set up to use this script to query the state indicated
in those logs.</para>

<para> It seemed rather more efficient to have a
<application>cron</application> job run the tests and have
<productname>Nagios</productname> check the results rather than having
<productname>Nagios</productname> run the tests directly.  The tests
can exercise the whole &slony1; cluster at once rather than
<productname>Nagios</productname> invoking updates over and over
again.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title> Other Replication Tests </title>

<para> The methodology of the previous section is designed with a view
to minimizing the cost of submitting replication test queries; on a
busy cluster, supporting hundreds of users, the cost associated with
running a few queries is likely to be pretty irrelevant, and the setup
cost to configure the tables and data injectors is pretty high.</para>

<para> Three other methods for analyzing the state of replication have
stood out:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> For an application-oriented test, it has been useful
to set up a view on some frequently updated table that pulls
application-specific information.  </para>

<para> For instance, one might look either at some statistics about a
most recently created application object, or an application
transaction.  For instance:</para>

<para> <command> create view replication_test as select now() -
txn_time as age, object_name from transaction_table order by txn_time
desc limit 1; </command> </para>

<para> <command> create view replication_test as select now() -
created_on as age, object_name from object_table order by id desc
limit 1; </command> </para>

<para> There is a downside: This approach requires that you have
regular activity going through the system that will lead to there
being new transactions on a regular basis.  If something breaks down
with your application, you may start getting spurious warnings about
replication being behind, despite the fact that replication is working
fine.</para>

</listitem>

<listitem><para> The &slony1;-defined view, <envar>sl_status</envar>
provides information as to how up to date different nodes are.  Its
contents are only really interesting on origin nodes, as the events
generated on other nodes are generally ignorable. </para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> See also the <xref linkend="slonymrtg">
discussion. </para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</sect2>
<sect2><title> Log Files</title>

<indexterm><primary>log files</primary></indexterm>

<para><xref linkend="slon"> daemons generate some more-or-less verbose
log files, depending on what debugging level is turned on.  You might
assortedly wish to:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> Use a log rotator like
<productname>Apache</productname>
<application>rotatelogs</application> to have a sequence of log files
so that no one of them gets too big;</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Purge out old log files,
periodically.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

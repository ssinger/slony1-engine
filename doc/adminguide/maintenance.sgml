<indexterm><primary>maintaining &slony1;</primary></indexterm>

<para>&slony1; actually does a lot of its necessary maintenance
itself, in a <quote>cleanup</quote> thread:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> Deletes old data from various tables in the
<productname>Slony-I</productname> cluster's namespace, notably
entries in &sllog1;, &sllog2;, and &slseqlog;.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Vacuum certain tables used by &slony1;.  As of 1.0.5,
this includes &pglistener;; in earlier versions, you must vacuum that
table heavily, otherwise you'll find replication slowing down because
&slony1; raises plenty of events, which leads to that table having
plenty of dead tuples.</para>

<para> In some versions (1.1, for sure; possibly 1.0.5) there is the
option of not bothering to vacuum any of these tables if you are using
something like <application>pg_autovacuum</application> to handle
vacuuming of these tables.  Unfortunately, it has been quite possible
for <application>pg_autovacuum</application> to not vacuum quite
frequently enough, so you may prefer to use the internal vacuums.
Vacuuming &pglistener; <quote>too often</quote> isn't nearly as
hazardous as not vacuuming it frequently enough.</para>

<para>Unfortunately, if you have long-running transactions, vacuums
cannot clear out dead tuples that are newer than the eldest
transaction that is still running.  This will most notably lead to
&pglistener; growing large and will slow
replication.</para></listitem>

<listitem> <para> The <link linkend="dupkey"> Duplicate Key Violation
</link> bug has helped track down a number of rather obscure
&postgres; race conditions, so that in modern versions of &slony1; and &postgres;, there should be little to worry about.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> As of version 1.2, <quote>log switching</quote>
functionality is in place; every so often (by default, once per week,
though you may induce it by calling the stored
function <function>logswitch_start()</function>), it seeks to switch
between storing data in &sllog1; and &sllog2; so that it may seek
to <command>TRUNCATE</command> the <quote>elder</quote> data.</para>

<para> That means that on a regular basis, these tables are completely
cleared out, so that you will not suffer from them having grown to
some significant size, due to heavy load, after which they are
incapable of shrinking back down </para> 

<para> In version 2.0, <command>DELETE</command> is no longer used to
clear out data in &sllog1; and &sllog2;; instead, the log switch logic
is induced frequently, every time the cleanup loop does not find a
switch in progress, and these tables are purely cleared out
via <command>TRUNCATE</command>.  This eliminates the need to vacuum
these tables. </para>

</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>

<sect2 id="maintenance-autovac"> <title> Interaction with &postgres;
autovacuum </title>

<indexterm><primary>autovacuum interaction</primary></indexterm>

<para> Recent versions of &postgres; support an
<quote>autovacuum</quote> process which notices when tables are
modified, thereby creating dead tuples, and vacuums those tables,
<quote>on demand.</quote> It has been observed that this can interact
somewhat negatively with &slony1;'s own vacuuming policies on its own
tables. </para>

<para> &slony1; requests vacuums on its tables immediately after
completing transactions that are expected to clean out old data, which
may be expected to be the ideal time to do so.  It appears as though
autovacuum may notice the changes a bit earlier, and attempts
vacuuming when transactions are not complete, rendering the work
pretty useless.  It seems preferable to configure autovacuum to avoid
vacuum &slony1;-managed configuration tables. </para>

<para> The following query (change the cluster name to match your
local configuration) will identify the tables that autovacuum should
be configured not to process: </para>

<programlisting>
mycluster=# select oid, relname from pg_class where relnamespace = (select oid from pg_namespace where nspname = '_' || 'MyCluster') and relhasindex;
  oid  |   relname    
-------+--------------
 17946 | sl_nodelock
 17963 | sl_setsync
 17994 | sl_trigger
 17980 | sl_table
 18003 | sl_sequence
 17937 | sl_node
 18034 | sl_listen
 18017 | sl_path
 18048 | sl_subscribe
 17951 | sl_set
 18062 | sl_event
 18069 | sl_confirm
 18074 | sl_seqlog
 18078 | sl_log_1
 18085 | sl_log_2
(15 rows)
</programlisting>

<para> The following query will populate
<envar>pg_catalog.pg_autovacuum</envar> with suitable configuration
information: <command> INSERT INTO pg_catalog.pg_autovacuum (vacrelid, enabled, vac_base_thresh, vac_scale_factor, anl_base_thresh, anl_scale_factor, vac_cost_delay, vac_cost_limit, freeze_min_age, freeze_max_age) SELECT oid, 'f', -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 FROM pg_catalog.pg_class WHERE relnamespace = (SELECT OID FROM pg_namespace WHERE nspname = '_' || 'MyCluster') AND relhasindex; </command>
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title> Watchdogs: Keeping Slons Running</title>

<indexterm><primary>watchdogs to keep slon daemons running</primary></indexterm>

<para>There are a couple of <quote>watchdog</quote> scripts available
that monitor things, and restart the <application>slon</application>
processes should they happen to die for some reason, such as a network
<quote>glitch</quote> that causes loss of connectivity.</para>

<para>You might want to run them...</para>

<para> The <quote>best new way</quote> of managing <xref
linkend="slon"> processes is via the combination of <xref
linkend="mkslonconf">, which creates a configuration file for each
node in a cluster, and <xref linkend="launchclusters">, which uses
those configuration files.</para>

<para> This approach is preferable to elder <quote>watchdog</quote>
systems in that you can very precisely <quote>nail down,</quote> in
each config file, the exact desired configuration for each node, and
not need to be concerned with what options the watchdog script may or
may not give you.  This is particularly important if you are using
<link linkend="logshipping"> log shipping </link>, where forgetting
the <command>-a</command> option could ruin your log shipped node, and
thereby your whole day.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="gensync"><title>Parallel to Watchdog: generate_syncs.sh</title>

<indexterm><primary>generate SYNCs</primary></indexterm>
<para>A new script for &slony1; 1.1 is
<application>generate_syncs.sh</application>, which addresses the following kind of
situation.</para>

<para>Supposing you have some possibly-flakey server where the
<application>slon</application> daemon that might not run all the time, you might
return from a weekend away only to discover the following situation.</para>

<para>On Friday night, something went <quote>bump</quote> and while the
database came back up, none of the <application>slon</application> daemons
survived.  Your online application then saw nearly three days worth of
reasonably heavy transaction load.</para>

<para>When you restart <application>slon</application> on Monday, it
hasn't done a SYNC on the master since Friday, so that the next
<quote>SYNC set</quote> comprises all of the updates between Friday
and Monday.  Yuck.</para>

<para>If you run <application>generate_syncs.sh</application> as a cron job every
20 minutes, it will force in a periodic <command>SYNC</command> on the origin, which
means that between Friday and Monday, the numerous updates are split
into more than 100 syncs, which can be applied incrementally, making
the cleanup a lot less unpleasant.</para>

<para>Note that if <command>SYNC</command>s <emphasis>are</emphasis> running
regularly, this script won't bother doing anything.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Testing &slony1; State </title>

<indexterm><primary>testing cluster status</primary></indexterm>

<para> In the <filename>tools</filename> directory, you will find
&lteststate; scripts called <filename>test_slony_state.pl</filename>
and <filename>test_slony_state-dbi.pl</filename>.  One uses the
Perl/DBI interface; the other uses the Pg interface.
</para>

<para> Both do essentially the same thing, namely to connect to a
&slony1; node (you can pick any one), and from that, determine all the
nodes in the cluster.  They then run a series of queries (read only,
so this should be quite safe to run) which examine various &slony1;
tables, looking for a variety of sorts of conditions suggestive of
problems, including:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> Bloating of tables like pg_listener, sl_log_1, sl_log_2, sl_seqlog </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> Listen paths </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> Analysis of Event propagation </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> Analysis of Event confirmation propagation </para> 

<para> If communications is a <emphasis>little</emphasis> broken,
replication may happen, but confirmations may not get back, which
prevents nodes from clearing out old events and old replication
data. </para> </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para> Running this once an hour or once a day can help you detect
symptoms of problems early, before they lead to performance
degradation. </para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Replication Test Scripts </title>

<para> In the directory <filename>tools</filename> may be found four
scripts that may be used to do monitoring of &slony1; instances:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> <command>test_slony_replication</command> is a
Perl script to which you can pass connection information to get to a
&slony1; node.  It then queries <xref linkend="table.sl-path"> and
other information on that node in order to determine the shape of the
requested replication set.</para>

<para> It then injects some test queries to a test table called
<envar>slony_test</envar> which is defined as follows, and which needs to be
added to the set of tables being replicated:

<programlisting>
CREATE TABLE slony_test (
    description text,
    mod_date timestamp with time zone,
    "_Slony-I_testcluster_rowID" bigint DEFAULT nextval('"_testcluster".sl_rowid_seq'::text) NOT NULL
);
</programlisting></para>

<para> The last column in that table was defined by &slony1; as one
lacking a primary key...</para>

<para> This script generates a line of output for each &slony1; node
that is active for the requested replication set in a file called
<filename>cluster.fact.log</filename>.</para>

<para> There is an additional <option>finalquery</option> option that allows
you to pass in an application-specific SQL query that can determine
something about the state of your application.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><command>log.pm</command> is a Perl module that manages logging
for the Perl scripts.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><command>run_rep_tests.sh</command> is a <quote>wrapper</quote> script
that runs <command>test_slony_replication</command>.</para>

<para> If you have several &slony1; clusters, you might set up
configuration in this file to connect to all those
clusters.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><command>nagios_slony_test</command> is a script that
was constructed to query the log files so that you might run the
replication tests every so often (we run them every 6 minutes), and
then a system monitoring tool such as <ulink
url="http://www.nagios.org/"> <productname>Nagios</productname>
</ulink> can be set up to use this script to query the state indicated
in those logs.</para>

<para> It seemed rather more efficient to have a
<application>cron</application> job run the tests and have
<productname>Nagios</productname> check the results rather than having
<productname>Nagios</productname> run the tests directly.  The tests
can exercise the whole &slony1; cluster at once rather than
<productname>Nagios</productname> invoking updates over and over
again.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title> Other Replication Tests </title>

<indexterm><primary>testing replication</primary></indexterm>

<para> The methodology of the previous section is designed with a view
to minimizing the cost of submitting replication test queries; on a
busy cluster, supporting hundreds of users, the cost associated with
running a few queries is likely to be pretty irrelevant, and the setup
cost to configure the tables and data injectors is pretty high.</para>

<para> Three other methods for analyzing the state of replication have
stood out:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> For an application-oriented test, it has been useful
to set up a view on some frequently updated table that pulls
application-specific information.  </para>

<para> For instance, one might look either at some statistics about a
most recently created application object, or an application
transaction.  For instance:</para>

<para> <command> create view replication_test as select now() -
txn_time as age, object_name from transaction_table order by txn_time
desc limit 1; </command> </para>

<para> <command> create view replication_test as select now() -
created_on as age, object_name from object_table order by id desc
limit 1; </command> </para>

<para> There is a downside: This approach requires that you have
regular activity going through the system that will lead to there
being new transactions on a regular basis.  If something breaks down
with your application, you may start getting spurious warnings about
replication being behind, despite the fact that replication is working
fine.</para>

</listitem>

<listitem><para> The &slony1;-defined view, <envar>sl_status</envar>
provides information as to how up to date different nodes are.  Its
contents are only really interesting on origin nodes, as the events
generated on other nodes are generally ignorable. </para>

<sect2><title> Log Files</title>

<indexterm><primary>log files</primary></indexterm>

<para><xref linkend="slon"> daemons generate some more-or-less verbose
log files, depending on what debugging level is turned on.  You might
assortedly wish to:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> Use a log rotator like
<productname>Apache</productname>
<application>rotatelogs</application> to have a sequence of log files

</para>
</sect2>
<sect2><title>mkservice </title>
<indexterm><primary>mkservice for BSD </primary></indexterm>

<sect3><title>slon-mkservice.sh</title>

<para> Create a slon service directory for use with svscan from
daemontools.  This uses multilog in a pretty basic way, which seems to
be standard for daemontools / multilog setups. If you want clever
logging, see logrep below. Currently this script has very limited
error handling capabilities.</para>

<para> For non-interactive use, set the following environment
variables.  <envar>BASEDIR</envar> <envar>SYSUSR</envar>
<envar>PASSFILE</envar> <envar>DBUSER</envar> <envar>HOST</envar>
<envar>PORT</envar> <envar>DATABASE</envar> <envar>CLUSTER</envar>

asks for configuration information interactively.</para>

<sect3><title>logrep-mkservice.sh</title>

<para>This uses <command>tail -F</command> to pull data from log files allowing
you to use multilog filters (by setting the CRITERIA) to create
special purpose log files. The goal is to provide a way to monitor log
files in near realtime for <quote>interesting</quote> data without either
hacking up the initial log file or wasting CPU/IO by re-scanning the
same log repeatedly.
</para>

<para>For non-interactive use, set the following environment
variables.  <envar>BASEDIR</envar> <envar>SYSUSR</envar> <envar>SOURCE</envar>
<envar>EXTENSION</envar> <envar>CRITERIA</envar> If any of the above are not set,
the script asks for configuration information interactively.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
<envar>BASEDIR</envar> where you want the service directory structure for the logrep
to be created. This should <emphasis>not</emphasis> be the <filename>/var/service</filename> directory.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><envar>SYSUSR</envar> unix user under which the service should run.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><envar>SOURCE</envar> name of the service with the log you want to follow.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><envar>EXTENSION</envar> a tag to differentiate this logrep from others using the same source.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><envar>CRITERIA</envar> the multilog filter you want to use.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para> A trivial example of this would be to provide a log file of all slon
ERROR messages which could be used to trigger a nagios alarm.
<command>EXTENSION='ERRORS'</command>
<command>CRITERIA="'-*' '+* * ERROR*'"</command>
(Reset the monitor by rotating the log using <command>svc -a $svc_dir</command>)
</para>

<para> A more interesting application is a subscription progress log.
<command>EXTENSION='COPY'</command>
<command>CRITERIA="'-*' '+* * ERROR*' '+* * WARN*' '+* * CONFIG enableSubscription*' '+* * DEBUG2 remoteWorkerThread_* prepare to copy table*' '+* * DEBUG2 remoteWorkerThread_* all tables for set * found on subscriber*' '+* * DEBUG2 remoteWorkerThread_* copy*' '+* * DEBUG2 remoteWorkerThread_* Begin COPY of table*' '+* * DEBUG2 remoteWorkerThread_* * bytes copied for table*' '+* * DEBUG2 remoteWorkerThread_* * seconds to*' '+* * DEBUG2 remoteWorkerThread_* set last_value of sequence*' '+* * DEBUG2 remoteWorkerThread_* copy_set*'"</command>
</para>

<para>If you have a subscription log then it's easy to determine if a given
slon is in the process of handling copies or other subscription activity.
If the log isn't empty, and doesn't end with a 
<command>"CONFIG enableSubscription: sub_set:1"</command>
(or whatever set number you've subscribed) then the slon is currently in
the middle of initial copies.</para>

<para> If you happen to be monitoring the mtime of your primary slony logs to 
determine if your slon has gone brain-dead, checking this is a good way
to avoid mistakenly clobbering it in the middle of a subscribe. As a bonus,
recall that since the the slons are running under svscan, you only need to
kill it (via the svc interface) and let svscan start it up again laster.
I've also found the COPY logs handy for following subscribe activity 
interactively.</para>

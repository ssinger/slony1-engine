<para>Before you subscribe a node to a set, be sure that you have
<xref linkend="slon"> processes running for both the provider and the
new subscribing node. If you don't have slons running, nothing will
happen, and you'll beat your head against a wall trying to figure out
what is going on.</para>

<para>Subscribing a node to a set is done by issuing the <xref
linkend="slonik"> command <xref linkend="stmtsubscribeset">. It may
seem tempting to try to subscribe several nodes to a set within a
single try block like this:

<programlisting>
try {
  echo 'Subscribing sets';
  subscribe set (id = 1, provider=1, receiver=2, forward=yes);
  subscribe set (id = 1, provider=1, receiver=3, forward=yes);
  subscribe set (id = 1, provider=1, receiver=4, forward=yes);
} on error {
  echo 'Could not subscribe the sets!';
  exit -1;
}
</programlisting></para>


<para> But you are just asking for trouble if you try to subscribe
sets in that fashion. The proper procedure is to subscribe one node at
a time, and to check the logs and databases before you move onto
subscribing the next node to the set. It is also worth noting that the
<quote>success</quote> within the above <xref linkend="slonik"> try
block does not imply that nodes 2, 3, and 4 have all been successfully
subscribed. It merely indicates that the slonik commands were
successfully received by the <application>slon</application> running
on the origin node.</para>

<para>A typical sort of problem that will arise is that a cascaded
subscriber is looking for a provider that is not ready yet.  In that
failure case, that subscriber node will <emphasis>never</emphasis>
pick up the provider.  It will get <quote>stuck</quote> waiting for
a past event to take place.  The other nodes will be convinced that it
is successfully subscribed (because no error report ever made it back
to them); a request to unsubscribe the node will be
<quote>blocked</quote> because the node is stuck on the attempt to
subscribe it.</para>

<para>When you subscribe a node to a set, you should see something
like this in your <application>slon</application> logs for the
provider node:

<screen>
DEBUG2 remoteWorkerThread_3: Received event 3,1059 SUBSCRIBE_SET
</screen>
</para>
<para>You should also start seeing log entries like this in the
<application>slon</application> logs for the subscribing node:

<screen>
DEBUG2 remoteWorkerThread_1: copy table public.my_table
</screen>
</para>
<para>It may take some time for larger tables to be copied from the
provider node to the new subscriber. If you check the pg_stat_activity
table on the provider node, you should see a query that is copying the
table to stdout.
</para>
<para>The table <envar>sl_subscribe</envar> on both the provider, and the new
subscriber should contain entries for the new subscription:

<screen>
 sub_set | sub_provider | sub_receiver | sub_forward | sub_active
---------+--------------+--------------+-------------+------------
      1  |            1 |            2 |           t |         t
</screen>
</para>
<para>A final test is to insert a row into one of the replicated
tables on the origin node, and verify that the row is copied to the
new subscriber.
</para>

<warning> <para> If you create and subscribe a set that does not
contain any tables, that can lead to a problem that will stop
replication from proceeding. </para>

<para> Note that this bug is addressed as of &slony1; 1.1.5 </para>

<para> If a particular subscriber is only being fed sequences by one
of its providers, the query that collects <command>SYNC</command>
event data will not be constructed correctly, and you will see error
messages similar to the following:</para>

<screen>
2007-04-13 07:11:28 PDT ERROR remoteWorkerThread_11: "declare LOG
cursor for select log_origin, log_xid, log_tableid, log_actionseq,
log_cmdtype, log_cmddata from "_T1".sl_log_1 where log_origin = 11 and
( order by log_actionseq; " PGRES_FATAL_ERROR ERROR: syntax error at
or near "order" at character 162
</screen>

<para> The function <xref
linkend="function.subscribeset-integer-integer-integer-boolean-boolean">
will generate a warning if given a replication set that lacks any
tables to replicate, as shown in the following example.</para>

<screen>
cbbrowne@dba2:/tmp> cat create_empty_set.slonik
cluster name = T1;
node 11 admin conninfo = 'dbname=slony_test1';
node 22 admin conninfo = 'dbname=slony_test2';

create set (id = 255, origin = 11, comment='blank empty set');
subscribe set (id=255, provider = 11, receiver = 22, forward = false);
</screen>

<para> This leads to the following warning message: </para>

<screen>

<para>Any platform that can run &postgres; should be able, in
principle, to run &slony1;.</para>

<indexterm><primary> platforms where &slony1; runs </primary> </indexterm>

<para>The platforms that have received specific testing are
FreeBSD-4X-i368, FreeBSD-5X-i386, FreeBSD-5X-alpha, OS-X-10.3,
Linux-2.4X-i386 Linux-2.6X-i386 Linux-2.6X-amd64,
<trademark>Solaris</trademark>-2.8-SPARC,
<trademark>Solaris</trademark>-2.9-SPARC, AIX 5.1 and 5.3,
OpenBSD-3.5-sparc64 and &windows; 2000, XP and 2003 (32 bit).  There
is enough diversity amongst these platforms that nothing ought to
prevent running &slony1; on other similar platforms. </para>

<title> &slony1; Software Dependancies</title>

<indexterm><primary> software dependancies </primary> </indexterm>

<para> At present, &slony1; <emphasis>as well as &postgres;</emphasis>
need to be able to be compiled from source at your site.</para>

<para> In order to compile &slony1;, you need to have the following
tools:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> GNU make.  Other make programs will not work.  GNU
make is often installed under the name <command>gmake</command>; this
document will therefore always refer to it by that name. (On
Linux-based systems GNU make is typically the default make, and is
called <command>make</command>) To test to see if your make is GNU
make enter <command>make version</command>.  Version 3.76 or later
will suffice; previous versions may not.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> You need an ISO/ANSI C compiler.  Recent versions of
<application>GCC</application> work.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> You also need a recent version of &postgres;
<emphasis>source</emphasis>.  &slony1; depends on namespace support so
you must have &postgres; version 8.3 or newer to be able to build
and use &slony1;.  </para>

</listitem>

<listitem><para> GNU packages may be included in the standard
packaging for your operating system, or you may need to look for
source code at your local GNU mirror (see <ulink
url="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html">
http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html </ulink> for a list) or at <ulink
url="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu"> ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu </ulink>
.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> If you need to obtain &postgres; source, you can
download it from your favorite &postgres; mirror.  See <ulink
url="http://www.postgresql.org/mirrors-www.html">
http://www.postgresql.org/mirrors-www.html </ulink> for a
list.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> This documentation is written in SGML using <ulink
url="http://docbook.com/"> DocBook </ulink>, and may be processed into
numerous formats including HTML, RTF, and PDF using tools in the
<ulink url="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/"> DocBook Open Repository
</ulink> along with <ulink url="http://openjade.sourceforge.net/">
OpenJade.</ulink> </para></listitem>

<listitem><para> On &windows; you will also need the same <ulink url=
"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/faqs.FAQ_MINGW.html">MinGW/Msys
Toolset</ulink> used to build &postgres; 8.3 and above.  In addition
you will need to install <ulink url=
"http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/">pthreads-win32
2.x</ulink>. </para></listitem>

</itemizedlist> </para>

<para>Also check to make sure you have sufficient disk space.  You
will need approximately 5MB for the source tree during build and
installation.</para>

<note><para>It is possible to compile
&slony1; separately from &postgres;, making it practical for the
makers of distributions of <productname>Linux</productname> and
<productname>FreeBSD</productname> to include precompiled binary
packages for &slony1;.  If no suitable packages are available, you
will need to be prepared to compile &slony1; yourself.  </para></note>

<sect2 id="encoding">
<title> Database Encoding </title>

<indexterm><primary> database encodings</primary></indexterm>

<para> &postgres; databases may be created in a number of language
encodings, set up via the <command>createdb --encoding=$ENCODING
databasename</command> option.  &slony1; assumes that they use
<emphasis>identical</emphasis> encodings.
</para>

<para> If the encodings are <quote>closely equivalent</quote>, you may
be able to get away with them not being absolutely identical.  For
instance, if the origin system used <envar>LATIN1</envar> and a
subscriber used <envar>SQL_ASCII</envar> and another subscriber used
<envar>UNICODE</envar>, and your application never challenges the
boundary conditions between these variant encodings, you may never
experience any problems.  </para>

<para> Note also that if the client encoding (configured assortedly in
<filename>postgresql.conf</filename>, parameter
<envar>client_encoding</envar>, or via the
<application>psql</application> <command>\encoding </command> command,
or the <application>psql</application> internal variable
<envar>ENCODING</envar>) varies from the server encoding, this
mismatch may lead to &slony1; being unable to replicate those
characters supported by the client encoding but not by the server
encoding. </para>

<sect2 id="times">
<title> Time Synchronization</title>

<indexterm><primary> time synchronization</primary></indexterm>

<para> All the servers used within the replication cluster need to
have their Real Time Clocks in sync. This is to ensure that <xref
linkend="slon"> doesn't generate errors with messages indicating that
a subscriber is already ahead of its provider during replication.
Interpreting logs when servers have a different idea of what time it
is leads to confusion and frustration.  It is recommended that you
have <application>ntpd</application> running on all nodes, where
subscriber nodes using the <quote>master</quote> provider host as
their time server.</para>

<para> It is possible for &slony1; itself to function even in the face
of there being some time discrepancies, but having systems <quote>in
sync</quote> is usually pretty important for distributed
applications.</para>

<para> See <ulink url="http://www.ntp.org/"> www.ntp.org </ulink> for
more details about NTP (Network Time Protocol).</para>

<para> Some users have reported problems that have been traced to
their locales indicating the use of some time zone that &postgres; did
not recognize.

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> On <productname>AIX</productname>,
<command><envar>TZ</envar>=CUT0</command> was unrecognized, leading to
timestamps pulled from system calls causing it to
break.</para>

<para> <command>CUT0</command> is a variant way of describing
<command>UTC</command></para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> Some countries' timezones are not yet included in
&postgres;.  </para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>

<para> In any case, what commonly seems to be the <quote>best
practice</quote> with &slony1; (and, for that matter, &postgres;) is
for the postmaster user and/or the user under which
<application>slon</application> runs to use
<command><envar>TZ</envar>=UTC</command> or
<command><envar>TZ</envar>=GMT</command>.  Those timezones are
<emphasis>sure</emphasis> to be supported on any platform, and have
the merit over <quote>local</quote> timezones that times never wind up
leaping around due to Daylight Savings Time.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2><title> Network Connectivity</title>

<indexterm><primary> network connectivity</primary></indexterm>

<para>It is necessary that the hosts that are to replicate between one
another have <emphasis>bidirectional</emphasis> network communications
between the &postgres; instances.  That is, if node B is replicating
data from node A, it is necessary that there be a path from A to B and
from B to A.  It is recommended that, as much as possible, all nodes
in a &slony1; cluster allow this sort of bidirection communications
from any node in the cluster to any other node in the cluster.</para>

<para>For ease of configuration, network addresses should ideally be
consistent across all of the nodes.  <xref linkend="stmtstorepath">
does allow them to vary, but down this road lies madness as you try to
manage the multiplicity of paths pointing to the same server.</para>

<para>A possible workaround for this, in environments where firewall
rules are particularly difficult to implement, may be to establish
<ulink url="http://www.brandonhutchinson.com/ssh_tunnelling.html"
id="tunnelling"> SSH Tunnels </ulink> that are created on each host
that allow remote access through a local IP address such as 127.0.0.1,
using a different port for each destination.</para>

<para> Note that <application>slonik</application> and the
<application>slon</application> instances need no special connections
or protocols to communicate with one another; they merely need access
to the &postgres; databases, connecting as a <quote>superuser</quote>
<link linkend="morethansuper">that has the ability to update system
tables.</link></para>

<para> An implication of this communications model is that the entire
extended network in which a &slony1; cluster operates must be able to
be treated as being secure.  If there is a remote location where you
cannot trust one of the databases that is a &slony1; node to be
considered <quote>secure,</quote> this represents a vulnerability that
can adversely affect the security of the entire cluster.  As a
<quote>peer-to-peer</quote> system, <emphasis>any</emphasis> of the
hosts is able to introduce replication events that will affect the
entire cluster.  Therefore, the security policies throughout the
cluster can only be considered as stringent as those applied at the
<emphasis>weakest</emphasis> link.  Running a &slony1; node at a
branch location that can't be kept secure compromises security for the
cluster as a whole.</para>

<para>New in &slony1; version 1.1 is a feature whereby updates for a
particular replication set may be serialized via a scheme called
&logshiplink;.  The data stored in <envar>sl_log_1</envar> and
<envar>sl_log_2</envar> is also written out to log files on disk.
These files may then be transmitted in any manner desired, whether via
scp, FTP, burning them onto DVD-ROMs and mailing them, or, at the
frivolous end of the spectrum, by recording them on a USB <quote>flash
device</quote> and attaching them to birds, allowing some equivalent
to <ulink url="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1149.html"> transmission of
IP datagrams on avian carriers - RFC 1149.</ulink> But whatever the
transmission mechanism, this allows one way communications such that
subscribers that use log shipping have no need of access to other
&slony1; nodes.</para>

<indexterm><primary>best practices for &slony1; usage</primary></indexterm>

<para> It is common for managers to have a desire to operate systems
using some available, documented set of <quote>best practices.</quote>
Documenting that sort of thing is essential to ISO 9000, ISO 9001, and
other sorts of organizational certifications. </para>

<para> It is worthwhile to preface a discussion of <quote>best
practices</quote> by mentioning that each organization that uses
&slony1; is unique, and there may be a need for local policies to
reflect unique local operating characteristics.  It is for that reason
that &slony1; does <emphasis>not</emphasis> impose its own policies
for such things as <link linkend="failover"> failover </link>; those
will need to be determined based on the overall shape of your network,
of your set of database servers, and of your usage patterns for those
servers. </para>

<para> There are, however, a number of things that early adopters of
&slony1; have discovered which can at least help to suggest the sorts
of policies you might want to consider. </para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para> &slony1; is a complex multi-client, multi-server
system, with the result that there are almost an innumerable set of
places where problems can arise.  </para> 

<para> As a natural result, maintaining a clean, consistent
environment is really valuable, as any sort of environmental
<quote>messiness</quote> can either cause unexpected problems or mask
the real problem. </para>

<para> Numerous users have reported problems resulting from mismatches
between &slony1; versions, local libraries, and &postgres; libraries.
Details count: you need to be clear on what hosts are running what
versions of what software. </para>

<para> This is normally a matter of being disciplined about how your
software is deployed, and the challenges represent a natural
consequence of being a distributed system comprised of a large number
of components that need to match. </para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> If a slonik script does not run as expected in a
first attempt, it would be foolhardy to attempt to run it again until
a problem has been found and resolved.  </para>

<para> There are a very few slonik commands such as <xref
linkend="stmtstorepath"> that behave in a nearly idempotent manner; if
you run <xref linkend="stmtstorepath"> again, that merely updates
table <envar>sl_path</envar> with the same value.  </para>

<para> In contrast <xref linkend="stmtsubscribeset"> behaves in two
<emphasis>very</emphasis> different ways depending on whether the
subscription has been activated yet or not; if initiating the
subscription didn't work at a first attempt, submitting the request
again <emphasis>won't</emphasis> help make it happen. </para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para> Principle: Use an unambiguous, stable time zone such
as UTC or GMT.</para>

<para> Users have run into problems with &lslon; functioning properly
when their system uses a time zone that &postgres; was unable to
recognize such as CUT0 or WST.  It is necessary that you use a
timezone that &postgres; can recognize correctly.  It is furthermore
preferable to use a time zone where times do not shift around due to
Daylight Savings Time. </para>

<para> The <quote>geographically unbiased</quote> choice seems to be
<command><envar>TZ</envar>=UTC</command> or
<command><envar>TZ</envar>=GMT</command>, and to make sure that
systems are <quote>in sync</quote> by using NTP to synchronize clocks
throughout the environment. </para>

<listitem>
<para> Principle: Long running transactions are Evil </para>

<para> The FAQ has an entry on <link linkend="pglistenerfull"> growth
of &pglistener; </link> which discusses this in a fair bit of detail;
the long and short is that long running transactions have numerous ill
effects.  They are particularly troublesome on an
<quote>origin</quote> node, holding onto locks, preventing vacuums
from taking effect, and the like.</para>

<para> In version 1.2, some of the <quote>evils</quote> should be
lessened, because:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> Events in &pglistener; are only generated when
replication updates are relatively infrequent, which should mean that
busy systems won't generate many dead tuples in that table
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> The system will periodically rotate (using
<command>TRUNCATE</command> to clean out the old table) between the
two log tables, &sllog1; and &sllog2;, preventing unbounded growth of
dead space there.  </para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</listitem>

<listitem>
<para> <link linkend="Failover"> Failover </link> policies
should be planned for ahead of time.  </para>

<para> Most pointedly, any node that is expected to be a failover
target must have its subscription(s) set up with the option
<command>FORWARD = YES</command>.  Otherwise, that node is not a
candidate for being promoted to origin node. </para>

<para> This may simply involve thinking about what the priority lists
should be of what should fail to what, as opposed to trying to
automate it.  But knowing what to do ahead of time cuts down on the
number of mistakes made.</para>

<para> At Afilias, a variety of internal <citation>The 3AM Unhappy
DBA's Guide to...</citation> guides have been created to provide
checklists of what to do when certain <quote>unhappy</quote> events
take place.  This sort of material is highly specific to the
environment and the set of applications running there, so you would
need to generate your own such documents.  This is one of the vital
components of any disaster recovery preparations.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> <xref linkend="stmtmoveset"> should be used to allow
preventative maintenance to prevent problems from becoming serious

<listitem> <para> <command>VACUUM</command> policy needs to be
carefully defined.</para>

<para> As mentioned above, <quote>long running transactions are
Evil.</quote> <command>VACUUM</command>s are no exception in this.  A
<command>VACUUM</command> on a huge table will open a long-running
transaction with all the known ill effects.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> If you are using the autovacuum process in recent
versions of &postgres;, you may wish to leave &slony1; tables out, as
&slony1; is a bit more intelligent about vacuuming when it is expected
to be conspicuously useful (<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis> - immediately
after purging old data) to do so than autovacuum can be. </para>

<para> See <xref linkend="maintenance-autovac"> for more
details. </para> </listitem>

<listitem> <para> Running all of the &lslon; daemons on a central
server for each network has proven preferable. </para>

<para> Each &lslon; should run on a host on the same local network as
the node that it is servicing, as it does a <emphasis>lot</emphasis>
of communications with its database, and that connection needs to be
as reliable as possible.  </para>

<para> In theory, the <quote>best</quote> speed might be expected to
come from running the &lslon; on the database server that it is
servicing. </para>

<para> In practice, strewing &lslon; processes and configuration
across a dozen servers turns out to be inconvenient to manage.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> &lslon; processes should run in the same
<quote>network context</quote> as the node that each is responsible
for managing so that the connection to that node is a
<quote>local</quote> one.  Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> run such links
across a WAN.  Thus, if you have nodes in London and nodes in New
York, the &lslon;s managing London nodes should run in London, and the
&lslon;s managing New York nodes should run in New York.</para>

<para> A WAN outage (or flakiness of the WAN in general) can leave
database connections <quote>zombied</quote>, and typical TCP/IP
behaviour <link linkend="multipleslonconnections"> will allow those
connections to persist, preventing a slon restart for around two
hours. </link> </para>

<para> It is not difficult to remedy this; you need only <command>kill
SIGINT</command> the offending backend connection.  But by running the
&lslon; locally, you will generally not be vulnerable to this
condition. </para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> Before getting too excited about having fallen into
some big problem, consider killing and restarting all the &lslon;
processes.  Historically, this has frequently been able to
resolve <quote>stickiness.</quote> </para>

<para> With a very few exceptions, it is generally not a big deal to
kill off and restart the &lslon; processes.  Each &lslon; connects to
one database for which it is the manager, and then connects to other
databases as needed to draw in events.  If you kill off a &lslon;, all
you do is to interrupt those connections.  If
a <command>SYNC</command> or other event is sitting there
half-processed, there's no problem: the transaction will roll back,
and when the &lslon; restarts, it will restart that event from
scratch.</para>

<para> The exception scenario where it is undesirable to restart a
&lslon; is where a <command>COPY_SET</command> is running on a large
replication set, such that stopping the &lslon; may discard several
hours worth of load work. </para>

<para> In early versions of &slony1;, it was frequently the case that
connections could get a bit <quote>deranged</quote> which restarting
&lslon;s would clean up.  This has become much more rare, but it has
occasionally proven useful to restart the &lslon;.  If there has been
any <quote>network derangement</quote>, this can clear up the issue of
defunct database connections.  </para> </listitem>

<para> Handling of Primary Keys </para> 

<para> Discussed in the section on <link linkend="definingsets">
Replication Sets, </link> it is <emphasis>ideal</emphasis> if each
replicated table has a true primary key constraint; it is
<emphasis>acceptable</emphasis> to use a <quote>candidate primary
key.</quote></para>

<para> It is <emphasis>not recommended</emphasis> that a
&slony1;-defined key (created via <xref linkend="stmttableaddkey">) be
used to introduce a candidate primary key, as this introduces the
possibility that updates to this table can fail due to the introduced
unique index, which means that &slony1; has introduced a new failure
mode for your application.  
</para>

<warning><para> In version 2 of &slony1;, <xref
linkend="stmttableaddkey"> is no longer supported.  You
<emphasis>must</emphasis> have either a true primary key or a
candidate primary key.  </para></warning>

lot of data should be taken with great care; the section on <link
linkend="dropthings"> Dropping things from &slony1; Replication</link>
discusses the different sorts of <quote>deletion</quote> that &slony1;
supports.  </para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para> <link linkend="Locking"> Locking issues </link></para>

<para> Certain &slony1; operations, notably <link
linkend="stmtsetaddtable"> <command>set add table</command> </link>,
<link linkend="stmtmoveset"> <command> move set</command> </link>,
<link linkend="stmtlockset"> <command> lock set </command> </link>,
and <link linkend="stmtddlscript"> <command>execute script</command>
</link> require acquiring <emphasis>exclusive locks</emphasis> on the
tables being replicated. </para>

<para> Depending on the kind of activity on the databases, this may or
may not have the effect of requiring a (hopefully brief) database
outage. </para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> What to do about DDL. </para>

<para> &slony1; operates via detecting updates to table data via
triggers that are attached to those tables.  That means that updates
that take place via methods that do not fire triggers will not notice
those updates.  <command>ALTER TABLE</command>, <command>CREATE OR
REPLACE FUNCTION</command>, <command>CREATE TABLE</command>, all
represent SQL requests that &slony1; has no way to notice. </para>

<para> A philosophy underlying &slony1;'s handling of this is that
competent system designers do not write self-modifying code, and
database schemas that get modified by the application are an instance
of this.  It does not try hard to make it convenient to modify
database schemas. </para>

<para> There will be cases where that is necessary, so the <link
linkend="stmtddlscript"> <command>execute script</command> is provided
which will apply DDL changes at the same location in the transaction
stream on all servers.  </link> </para>

<para> Unfortunately, this introduces a great deal of locking of
database objects.  Altering tables requires taking out an exclusive
lock on them; doing so via <command>execute script</command> requires
that &slony1; take out an exclusive lock on <emphasis>all</emphasis>
replicated tables.  This can prove quite inconvenient if applications
are running when running DDL; &slony1; is asking for those exclusive
table locks, whilst, simultaneously, some application connections are
gradually relinquishing locks, whilst others are backing up behind the
&slony1; locks.  </para>

<para> One particularly dogmatic position that some hold is that
<emphasis>all</emphasis> schema changes should
<emphasis>always</emphasis> be propagated using <command>execute
script</command>.  This guarantees that nodes will be consistent, but
the costs of locking and deadlocking may be too high for some
users.</para>

<para> At Afilias, our approach has been less dogmatic; there
<emphasis>are</emphasis> sorts of changes that
<emphasis>must</emphasis> be applied using <command>execute
script</command>, but we apply others independently.</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> Changes that must be applied using <command>execute script</command> </para>

<listitem><para> All instances of <command>ALTER TABLE</command></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> <command>CREATE TABLE</command> </para>
<para> Tables that are not being replicated do not require &slony1; <quote>permission</quote>. </para></listitem>

<listitem><para> <command>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION </command> </para>

<para> Typically, new versions of functions may be done without
&slony1; being <quote>aware</quote> of them.  The obvious exception is
when a new function is being deployed to accomodate a table
alteration; in that case, the new version must be added in in a manner
synchronized with the <command>execute script</command> for the table
alteration. </para>

<para> Similarly, <command>CREATE TYPE</command>, <command> CREATE
AGGREGATE </command>,  and such will
commonly not need to be forcibly applied in <quote>perfectly
synchronized</quote> manner across nodes. </para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Security management, such as <command> CREATE USER
</command>, <command> CREATE ROLE </command>, <command>GRANT
</command>, and such are largely irrelevant to &slony1; as it runs as
a <quote>superuser</quote>. </para>

<para> Indeed, we have frequently found it useful to have different
security arrangements on different nodes.  Access to the
<quote>master</quote> node should be restricted to applications that
truly need access to it; <quote>reporting</quote> users commonly are
restricted much more there than on subscriber nodes.</para>

</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</itemizedlist>

</listitem>

<listitem id="slonyuser"> <para> &slony1;-specific user names. </para>

<para> It has proven useful to define a <command>slony</command> user
for use by &slony1;, as distinct from a generic
<command>postgres</command> or <command>pgsql</command> user.  </para>

<para> If all sorts of automatic <quote>maintenance</quote>
activities, such as <command>vacuum</command>ing and performing
backups, are performed under the <quote>ownership</quote> of a single
&postgres; user, it turns out to be pretty easy to run into deadlock
problems. </para>

<para> For instance, a series of <command>vacuums</command> that
unexpectedly run against a database that has a large
<command>SUBSCRIBE_SET</command> event under way may run into a
deadlock which would roll back several hours worth of data copying
work.</para>

<para> If, instead, different maintenance roles are performed by
different users, you may, during vital operations such as
<command>SUBSCRIBE_SET</command>, lock out other users at the
<filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> level, only allowing the
<command>slony</command> user in, which substantially reduces the risk
of problems while the subscription is in progress.

</listitem>

<listitem><para> Lowering Authority </para>

<para> Traditionally, it has been stated that <quote>&slony1; needs to
use superuser connections.</quote> It turns out that this is not
entirely true, and and if there are particular concerns about
excessive use of superuser accounts, it is possible to reduce this
considerably. </para>

<para> It is true to say that each &lslon; <emphasis>must</emphasis>
have a superuser connection in order to manage the node that it is
assigned to.  It needs to be able to alter the system catalogue in
order to set up subscriptions and to process alterations
(<emphasis>e.g</emphasis> - to run <xref linkend="stmtddlscript"> and
other events that may alter the role of replicated tables on the local
node).  </para>

<para> However, the connections that &lslon; processes open to other
nodes to access events and process subcriptions do not need to have
nearly so much permission.  Indeed, one could set up a <quote>weak
user</quote> assigned to all <xref linkend="stmtstorepath"> requests.
The minimal permissions that this user, let's call it
<command>weakuser</command>, requires are as follows:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> It must have read access to the &slony1;-specific namespace </para> </listitem>
<listitem><para> It must have read access to all tables and sequences in that namespace</para> </listitem>

<listitem><para> At subscribe time, it must have read access to all of the replicated tables. </para> 
<para> Outside of subscription time, there is no need for access to access to the replicated tables. </para> </listitem>
<listitem><para> There is some need for read access to tables in pg_catalog; it has not been verified how little access would be suitable. </para> </listitem>

linkend="table.sl-listen">.</para>

<para> As of &slony1; 1.1, its contents are computed automatically
based on the communications information available to &slony1; which
should alleviate the problems found in earlier versions where this had

failures, where nodes failed to talk to one another even though they
technically could, were a result of incorrect listen path
configuration. </para>

<para> Configuring &lslon; </para>

<quote>Best</quote> practices have yet to emerge from the two
options:</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para> Configuration via command line options</para> 

<para> This approach has the merit that all the options that are
active are visible in the process environment.  (And if there are a
lot of them, they may be a nuisance to read.)</para>

<para> Unfortunately, if you invoke &lslon; from the
command line, you could <emphasis>forget</emphasis> to include
&logshiplink; configuration and thereby destroy the sequence of logs
for a log shipping node. </para>
</listitem>

<listitem> <para> Unlike when command line options are used, the
active options are <emphasis>not</emphasis> visible.  They can only be
inferred from the name and/or contents of the &lslon;
configuration file, and will not reflect subsequent changes to the
configuration file.  </para>

<para> By putting the options in a file, you won't forget including
any of them, so this is safer for &logshiplink;. </para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> Things to do when subscribing nodes </para>

<para> When a new node is running the <command>COPY_SET</command>
event for a large replication set (<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis> - one
which takes several hours to subscribe) it has been found to be
desirable to lock all users other than the <command>slony</command>
user out of the new subscriber because:
</para>

<para> It is also a very good idea to change &lslon; configuration for
<xref linkend="slon-config-sync-interval"> on the origin node to
reduce how many <command>SYNC</command> events are generated.  If the
subscription takes 8 hours, there is little sense in there being 28800
<command>SYNC</command>s waiting to be applied.  Running a
<command>SYNC</command> every minute or so is likely to make catching
up easier.</para>

</itemizedlist>

<para> It <emphasis>may</emphasis> be worth considering turning the
&postgres; <function>fsync</function> functionality off during the
copying of data, as this will improve performance, and if the database
<quote>falls over</quote> during the <command>COPY_SET</command>

<listitem><para> Handling Very Large Replication Sets </para>

<para> Some users have set up replication on replication sets that are
tens to hundreds of gigabytes in size, which puts some added
<quote>strain</quote> on the system, in particular where it may take
several days for the <command>COPY_SET</command> event to complete.
Here are some principles that have been observed for dealing with
these sorts of situations.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> Drop all indices other than the primary key index
while the <command>COPY_SET</command> event is run. </para>

<para> When data is copied into a table that has indices on it,
&postgres; builds the indices incrementally, on the fly.  This is much
slower than simply copying the data into the table, and then
recreating each index <quote>ex nihilo</quote>, as the latter can take
substantial advantage of sort memory. </para>

<para> In &slony1; version 1.1.5 and later versions, indices are
dropped and recreated automatically, which effectively invalidates
this practice.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> If there are large numbers of updates taking place as
the large set is being copied, this can lead to the subscriber being
behind by some enormous number of <command>SYNC</command> events.</para>

<para> If a <command> SYNC </command> is generated about once per
second, that leads to the subscriber <quote>falling behind</quote> by
around 90,000 <command>SYNC</command>s per day, possibly for several
days.  </para>

<para> There will correspondingly be an <emphasis>enormous</emphasis>
growth of &sllog1;, &sllog2;, and &slseqlog;.  Unfortunately, once the
<command>COPY_SET</command> completes, users have found that the
queries against these tables wind up reverting to <command>Seq
Scans</command> so that even though a particular
<command>SYNC</command> processing event is only processing a small
number of those 90,000 <command>SYNC</command> events, it still reads
through the entire table.  In such a case, you may never see
replication catch up.
</para> 

<para> Several things can be done that will help, involving
careful selection of &lslon; parameters:</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> Ensure that there exists, on the
<quote>master</quote> node, an index on <function> sl_log_1(log_xid)
</function>.  If it doesn't exist, as the &slony1; instance was set up
before version 1.1.1, see <filename> slony1_base.sql </filename> for
the exact form that the index setup should take. </para> 

<para> In 1.2 and later versions, there is a process that runs
automatically to add partial indexes by origin node number, which
should be the optimal form for such an index to take.  </para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> On the subscriber's &lslon;, increase
the number of <command>SYNC</command> events processed together, with
the <xref linkend= "slon-config-sync-group-maxsize"> parameter to some
value that allows it to process a significant portion of the
outstanding <command>SYNC</command> events. </para> </listitem>

<listitem><para> On the subscriber's &lslon;, set the
<xref linkend="slon-config-desired-sync-time"> to 0, as the adaptive
<command>SYNC</command> grouping system will start with small
groupings that will, under these circumstances, perform
poorly. </para> </listitem>

<listitem><para> Increase the <xref
linkend="slon-config-sync-interval"> on the origin's <xref
linkend="slon"> so that <command>SYNC</command> events are generated
less frequently.  If a <command>SYNC</command> is only generated once
per minute instead of once per second, that will cut down the number
of events by a factor of 60. </para> </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> It is likely to be worthwhile to use <xref
linkend="slon-config-vac-frequency"> to deactivate <xref
linkend="slon">-initiated vacuuming in favor of running your own
vacuum scripts, as there will be a buildup of unpurgeable data while
the data is copied and the subscriber starts to catch up. </para>

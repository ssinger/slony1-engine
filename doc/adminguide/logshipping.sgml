<title>Log Shipping - &slony1; with Files</title>
<indexterm><primary>log shipping</primary></indexterm>

<para> One of the new features for 1.1, that only really stabilized as
of 1.2.11, is the ability to serialize the updates to go out into log
files that can be kept in a spool directory.</para>

<para> The spool files could then be transferred via whatever means
was desired to a <quote>slave system,</quote> whether that be via FTP,
rsync, or perhaps even by pushing them onto a 1GB <quote>USB
key</quote> to be sent to the destination by clipping it to the ankle
of some sort of <quote>avian transport</quote> system.</para>

<para> There are plenty of neat things you can do with a data stream
in this form, including:

<itemizedlist>
  
  <listitem><para> Replicating to nodes that
  <emphasis>aren't</emphasis> securable</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para> Replicating to destinations where it is not
  possible to set up bidirection communications</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para> Supporting a different form of <acronym>PITR</acronym>
  (Point In Time Recovery) that filters out read-only transactions and
  updates to tables that are not of interest.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para> If some disaster strikes, you can look at the logs
  of queries in detail</para>

  <para> This makes log shipping potentially useful even though you
  might not intend to actually create a log-shipped
  node.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para> This is a really slick scheme for building load for
  doing tests</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para> We have a data <quote>escrow</quote> system that
  would become incredibly cheaper given log shipping</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para> You may apply triggers on the <quote>disconnected
  node </quote> to do additional processing on the data</para>

  <para> For instance, you might take a fairly <quote>stateful</quote>
  database and turn it into a <quote>temporal</quote> one by use of
  triggers that implement the techniques described in
  <citation>Developing Time-Oriented Database Applications in SQL

<question> <para> Where are the <quote>spool files</quote> for a
subscription set generated?</para>
</question>

<answer> <para> Any <link linkend="slon"> slon </link> subscriber node
can generate them by adding the <option>-a</option> option.</para>

<note><para> Notice that this implies that in order to use log
shipping, you must have at least one subscriber node. </para></note>
</answer>

</qandaentry>

<qandaentry> <question> <para> What takes place when a <xref
linkend="stmtfailover">/ <xref linkend="stmtmoveset"> takes
place?</para></question>

<answer><para> Nothing special.  So long as the archiving node remains
a subscriber, it will continue to generate logs.</para></answer>

<answer> <warning> <para>If the archiving node becomes the origin, on
the other hand, it will continue to generate logs.</para> </warning></answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry> <question> <para> What if we run out of <quote>spool
space</quote>?  </para></question>

<answer><para> The node will stop accepting <command>SYNC</command>s
until this problem is alleviated.  The database being subscribed to
will also fall behind.  </para></answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question> <para> How do we set up a subscription?  </para></question>

<answer><para> The script in <filename>tools</filename> called
<application>slony1_dump.sh</application> is a shell script that dumps
the <quote>present</quote> state of the subscriber node.</para>

<para> You need to start the <application><link linkend="slon"> slon
</link></application> for the subscriber node with logging turned on.
At any point after that, you can run
<application>slony1_dump.sh</application>, which will pull the state
of that subscriber as of some <command>SYNC</command> event.  Once the
dump completes, all the <command>SYNC</command> logs generated from
the time that dump <emphasis>started</emphasis> may be added to the
dump in order to get a <quote>log shipping subscriber.</quote>
</para></answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry> <question><para> What are the limitations of log
shipping? </para>
</question>

<answer><para> In the initial release, there are rather a lot of
limitations.  As releases progress, hopefully some of these
limitations may be alleviated/eliminated. </para> </answer>

<answer><para> The log shipping functionality amounts to
<quote>sniffing</quote> the data applied at a particular subscriber
node.  As a result, you must have at least one <quote>regular</quote>
node; you cannot have a cluster that consists solely of an origin and
a set of <quote>log shipping nodes.</quote>. </para></answer>

<answer><para> The <quote>log shipping node</quote> tracks the
entirety of the traffic going to a subscriber.  You cannot separate
things out if there are multiple replication sets.  </para></answer>

<answer><para> The <quote>log shipping node</quote> presently only
fully tracks <command>SYNC</command> events.  This should be
sufficient to cope with <emphasis>some</emphasis> changes in cluster
configuration, but not others.  </para>

<para> A number of event types <emphasis> are </emphasis> handled in
such a way that log shipping copes with them:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para><command>SYNC </command> events are, of course,
handled.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><command>DDL_SCRIPT</command> is handled.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><command> UNSUBSCRIBE_SET </command></para> 

<para> This event, much like <command>SUBSCRIBE_SET</command> is not
handled by the log shipping code.  But its effect is, namely that
<command>SYNC</command> events on the subscriber node will no longer
contain updates to the set.</para>

<para> Similarly, <command>SET_DROP_TABLE</command>,
<command>SET_DROP_SEQUENCE</command>,
<command>SET_MOVE_TABLE</command>,
<command>SET_MOVE_SEQUENCE</command>,
<command>DROP_SET</command>,
<command>MERGE_SET</command>, will be handled
<quote>apropriately</quote>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><command> SUBSCRIBE_SET </command></para>

<para> Unfortunately, there is some <quote>strangeness</quote> in the
handling of this...  When <command>SUBSCRIBE_SET</command> occurs, it
leads to an event being raised, and processed, <emphasis>purely on the
subscriber</emphasis>, called <command>ENABLE_SUBSCRIPTION</command>.</para>

<para> <command> SUBSCRIBE_SET </command> is really quite a simple
event; it merely <emphasis>declares</emphasis> that a node is
subscribing to a particular set via a particular provider.  <emphasis>
It doesn't copy data!</emphasis> </para>

<para> The meat of the subscription work is done by
<command>ENABLE_SUBSCRIPTION</command>, which is an event that is
raised on the local node, not in the same sequence as the other events
coming from other nodes (notably the data provider). </para>

<para> With revisions in sequencing of logs that took place in 1.2.11,
this now presents no problem for the user.</para>

</listitem> 

<listitem><para> The various events involved in node configuration are
irrelevant to log shipping:

<command>STORE_NODE</command>,
<command>ENABLE_NODE</command>,
<command>DROP_NODE</command>,
<command>STORE_PATH</command>,
<command>DROP_PATH</command>,
<command>STORE_LISTEN</command>,
<command>DROP_LISTEN</command></para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Events involved in describing how particular sets are
to be initially configured are similarly irrelevant:

<command>STORE_SET</command>,
<command>SET_ADD_TABLE</command>,
<command>SET_ADD_SEQUENCE</command>,
<command>STORE_TRIGGER</command>,
<command>DROP_TRIGGER</command>,
<command>TABLE_ADD_KEY</command>
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>
</answer>

<answer><para> It would be nice to be able to turn a <quote>log
shipped</quote> node into a fully communicating &slony1; node that you
could failover to.  This would be quite useful if you were trying to
construct a cluster of (say) 6 nodes; you could start by creating one
subscriber, and then use log shipping to populate the other 4 in
parallel.</para>

<para> This usage is not supported, but presumably one could add the
&slony1; configuration to the node, and promote it into being a new
node.  Again, a Simple Matter Of Programming (that might not
necessarily be all that simple)... </para></answer>
</qandaentry>
</qandaset>

<sect2><title> Usage Hints </title>

<note> <para> Here are some more-or-less disorganized notes about how
you might want to use log shipping...</para> </note>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> You <emphasis>don't</emphasis> want to blindly apply
<command>SYNC</command> files because any given
<command>SYNC</command> file may <emphasis>not</emphasis> be the right
one.  If it's wrong, then the result will be that the call to
<function> setsyncTracking_offline() </function> will fail, and your
<application> psql</application> session will <command> ABORT
</command>, and then run through the remainder of that
<command>SYNC</command> file looking for a <command>COMMIT</command>
or <command>ROLLBACK</command> so that it can try to move on to the
next transaction.</para>

<para> But we <emphasis> know </emphasis> that the entire remainder of
the file will fail!  It is futile to go through the parsing effort of
reading the remainder of the file.</para>

<para> Better idea: 

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> Read the first few lines of the file, up to and
including the <function> setsyncTracking_offline() </function>
call.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Try to apply it that far.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> If that failed, then it is futile to continue;
<command>ROLLBACK</command> the transaction, and perhaps consider
trying the next file.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> If the <function> setsyncTracking_offline()
</function> call succeeds, then you have the right next
<command>SYNC</command> file, and should apply it.  You should
probably <command>ROLLBACK</command> the transaction, and then use
<application>psql</application> to apply the entire file full of
updates.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>

<para> In order to support the approach of grabbing just the first few
lines of the sync file, the format has been set up to have a line of
dashes at the end of the <quote>header</quote> material:

<programlisting>
-- Slony-I log shipping archive
-- Node 11, Event 656
start transaction;

select "_T1".setsyncTracking_offline(1, '655', '656', '2007-09-23 18:37:40.206342');
-- end of log archiving header
</programlisting></para></listitem>


<listitem><para> Note that the header includes a timestamp indicating
SYNC time. 
<programlisting>
-- Slony-I log shipping archive
-- Node 11, Event 109
start transaction;

select "_T1".setsyncTracking_offline(1, '96', '109', '2007-09-23 19:01:31.267403');
-- end of log archiving header
</programlisting></para>

<para> This timestamp represents the time at which the
<command>SYNC</command> was issued on the origin node.</para>

<para> The value is stored in the log shipping configuration table
sl_setsync_offline.</para>

<para> If you are constructing a temporal database, this is likely to
represent the time you will wish to have apply to all of the data in
the given log shipping transaction log. </para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> You may find information on how relevant activity is
logged in <xref linkend="logshiplog">. </para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para> As of 1.2.11, there is an <emphasis>even better idea</emphasis>
for application of logs, as the sequencing of their names becomes more
predictable.</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> The table, on the log shipped node, tracks which log
it most recently applied in table
<envar>sl_archive_tracking</envar>. </para>

<para> Thus, you may predict the ID number of the next file by taking
the latest counter from this table and adding 1.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> There is still variation as to the filename,
depending on what the overall set of nodes in the cluster are.  All
nodes periodically generate <command>SYNC</command> events, even if
they are not an origin node, and the log shipping system does generate
logs for such events. </para>

<para> As a result, when searching for the next file, it is necessary
to search for files in a manner similar to the following:

<programlisting>
ARCHIVEDIR=/var/spool/slony/archivelogs/node4
SLONYCLUSTER=mycluster
PGDATABASE=logshipdb
PGHOST=logshiphost
NEXTQUERY="select at_counter+1 from \"_${SLONYCLUSTER}\".sl_archive_tracking;"
nextseq=`psql -d ${PGDATABASE} -h ${PGHOST} -A -t -c "${NEXTQUERY}"
filespec=`printf "slony1_log_*_%20d.sql"
for file in `find $ARCHIVEDIR -name "${filespec}"; do
   psql -d ${PGDATABASE} -h ${PGHOST} -f ${file}
done
</programlisting>
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> </para> </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</sect2>

<sect2><title> <application> find-triggers-to-deactivate.sh
</application> </title>

<indexterm><primary> trigger deactivation </primary> </indexterm>

<para> It was once pointed out (<ulink
url="http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19"> Bugzilla bug
#19</ulink>) that the dump of a schema may include triggers and rules
that you may not wish to have running on the log shipped node.</para>

<para> The tool <filename> tools/find-triggers-to-deactivate.sh
</filename> was created to assist with this task.  It may be run
against the node that is to be used as a schema source, and it will
list the rules and triggers present on that node that may, in turn
need to be deactivated.</para>

<para> It includes <function>logtrigger</function> and <function>denyaccess</function>
triggers which will may be left out of the extracted schema, but it is
still worth the Gentle Administrator verifying that such triggers are
kept out of the log shipped replica.</para>

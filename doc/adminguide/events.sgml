<title>Events & Confirmations</title>
<para>
&slony1; transfers configuration changes and application data through
events.   Events in &slony1; have an origin, a type and some parameters.   
When an event is created it is inserted
into the event queue (the <xref linkend="table.sl-event"> table) on the node the event
originates on.  The remoteListener threads of slon processes then pick up
that event (by quering the sl_event table) and passing the event to the
slons remoteWorker thread for processing.
</para>

<para>
An event is uniquely identified by taking both the node id of the node the
event originates on and the event sequence number for that node.
For example (1,5000001) identifies event 5000001 originating from node 1.
While (3,5000001) identifies a different event that originated on a 
different node.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>SYNC Events</title>
<para>
SYNC events are used to transfer application data for one node to the next.
When data in a replicated table changes a trigger fires that records information
about the change in the <xref linkend="table.sl-log-1"> or <xref linkend="table.sl-log-2"> tables.  The localListener thread
in the slon processes will then periodically generate a SYNC event.  When the
SYNC event is created &slony1; will find the heighest log_seqid assigned so far
along with a list of log_seqid's that were assigned to transactions that
have not yet been committed.  This information is stored as part of the SYNC 
event.
</para>


<para>
When a slon processes remoteWorker processes a SYNC it will query the rows
from sl_log_1 and sl_log2 that are covered by the SYNC (log_seqid rows
that had been committed at the time the SYNC was generated).  The modifications
described by these rows are then made on the subscriber.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Event Confirmations</title>
<para>
When an event is processed by the slon for a remote node a CONFIRM message
is generated by inserting a row into the sl_confirm table.  This row indicates
that a particular event was confirmed by a particular receiver node.
Confirmation messages are the transfered back to all other nodes in the cluster.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Event cleanup</title>
<para>
The slon cleanupThread will periodically run the
<xref linkend="function.cleanupevent-interval-boolean"> database
function that will delete all but the most recently confirmed event for 
each origin/receiver pair (because if an event has been confirmed by a 
receiver then all older events from that origin have also been confirmed
by the receiver).   Then the function will delete any SYNC events that are
older than the oldest row left in sl_confirm (for each origin). The data 
for these deleted events will also be removed from the sl_log_1 and sl_log_2
tables.
</para>
<para>
When &slony1; is first enabled it will log the data to replicate to the
sl_log_1 table.  After a while it will stop logging to sl_log_1 and switch
to logging on sl_log_2.  When all of rows in  in sl_log_1 have been replicated
&slony1; will TRUNCATE the sl_log_1 table (to clear out the dead tuples), 
stop logging to sl_log_2 and switch back to logging to the newly truncated 
sl_log_1 table.  This process will be periodically repeated as &slony1; runs.

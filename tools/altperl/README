This is a "second system" set of scripts for managing a set of Slony-I
instances.

Unlike the shell scripts that have been used, previously, it allows
having an arbitrary number of Slony-I nodes.  They are configured in
slon.env by calling add_node() once for each node that is needed.

The following configuration is set up:

 $SETNAME represents the name of the cluster.  In each database
  involved in the replication set, you will find the namespace
  "_$SETNAME" that contains Slony-I's configuration tables

 $SLON_BIN_PATH is the path to use to find the slon and slonik
   binaries.

 $LOGDIR is the directory in which to put log files.  The script will
   generate a subdirectory for each node.

 $APACHE_ROTATOR is an optional reference to the location of the
   Apache log rotator; if you set it to a path to an Apache "rotatelog"
   program, that will be used to keep log file size down to a "dull
   roar".
  <http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/programs/rotatelogs.html>

slon.env also contains lists of tables that are to be replicated:

  @PKEYEDTABLES contains all of the tables that have primary keys

  %KEYEDTABLES contains tables with candidate primary keys associated
    with the index you _want_.

  @SERIALTABLES contains tables that do not have a unique key
                to which Slony-I will need to add and populate
                a unique key

  @SEQUENCES lists all of the application sequences that are to be
             replicated.

Alas, this means that the values are "hardcoded" as far as the tools
are concerned.

To make this more flexible, slon.env looks at the environment variable
SLONYENV as an alternative source for this configuration.  

That way, you may do something like:

   for i in `seq 10`; do
      SLONYENV="./set$i.config" ./init_cluster.pl
   done

- Such an "alternative slon.env" might import Pg, and do queries
against a database to be replicated in order to populate the sets of
tables and such.

- The "alternative slon.env" might search some sort of 'registry' for
the set of nodes to be replicated.

Steps to start up replication
-------------------------------

0.  Dump from source system to destination
 pg_dump -s -c  flex1 | psql flex2
  
1. Initializes the Slony cluster
  ./init_cluster.pl

  This sets up a FULL cross-join set of paths and listeners, doing
  something of a shortest-path evaluation of which "store listens" to
  set up.

2. Start up slon servers for both DB instances
  ./slon_start.pl node1
  ./slon_start.pl node2

3. Sets up all the tables for "set 1" for FlexReg 2.0  
  ./create_set.pl set1
    
4. Subscribe Node #2 to Set #1
  ./subscribe_set.pl set1 node2
     This is the Big One...

That SHOULD be it, although "should" is probably too strong a word :-)

There are numerous other tools for adding/dropping Slony-I
configuration, and scripts that might manage simple forms of
switchover/failover.

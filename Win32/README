Preliminary Win32 Support
------------------------------------

As per the README.compiling documentation, Andreas Pflug has
contributed Makefiles that may be useful for those that wish to
compile Slony-I components on Win32.

I haven't included his address.  If you want to assist in providing
Win32 support, it may be worth contacting him.  Otherwise, it seems
inappropriate to pester him about problems compiling this.

There are two files provided:

 1.  Makefile.backend

     This makefile should be suitable for building the C components
     found in the src/backend directory.

 2.  Makefile.xxid

     This should be suitable for building the C components found in
     src/xxid.

These files would replace those that ./configure would produce in
those directories.

There are no makefiles for building slon or slonik:

 - In the case of slon, there appears to be some issue with linking
   in a pthreads library.  Someone who is familiar with the use of
   pthreads on Win32 may be able to resolve this.

   In the absence of a slon that runs on Win32, you ought to be able
   to run slon processes on Unix-like operating systems.

 - In the case of slonik, the use of fork() apparently makes the port
   more challenging.  

   Andreas has been working on adding Slony-I management tools to
   pgAdmin III, which does run on Microsoft Windows(tm).  That may be
   an alternative to slonik.

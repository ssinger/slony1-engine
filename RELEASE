* Slony-I Release Notes

** 2.1.0 (beta 3)

- Bug #159 :: distclean deletes the slony_logshipper flex/bison generated files.

- Bug #204 :: Additional fixes for failover to a non-direct subscriber
              where circular paths in sl_subscribe could happen

- Bug #214 :: Add slonikconfdump.sh back into tools

- Bug #216 :: Use EPOCH for the timestamp in the monitor thread
              to avoid differences in how Win32 handles timezones.

- Bug #218 :: Acquire lock on sl_config_lock in much the same fashion as
            with sl_event_lock (bug #196)

- Bug #219 :: Default to PostgreSQL 8.4 support if the version of PG is newer
             than what slony recognizes.

- Bug #220 :: Fix issue where changing the provider of an existing
              subscriber passed parameters in the wrong order to the
              stored procedure.

- Bug #222 :: Fixing issue where new connections that call the
              logtrigger for the first time might block until an
              in progress cleanupEvent finishes.

- Bug #223 :: Clear out the last saved event number when uninstalling
              a node.  This prevents slonik from waiting for a node it just
              uninstalled.

- Bug #224 :: altperl code misspelled "PKEYDTABLES"

*** Some items without bug numbers:

- Fixed slonik memory corruption when it tries to get the last known
  event_id from a node that doesn't yet have slony installed.

- Remove rules for building PDFs for the original design docs, in
  favor of having the built docs stored in a new "historical
  documentation" directory.

** 2.1.0 (beta 2)
- Bug 219 :: Default to PostgreSQL 8.4 support if the version of PG is newer than
          what slony recognizes.

- Fix threading issue in monitor_thread where slon_init can be called
  without the mutex being locked. This function was written to assume
  the mutex lock exists.  

-  datarootdir warning from autoconf fixed  

- Bug #36  - (Reapplied) don't link with pgport on non-Win32 platforms

- Misc compiler warnings including no longer calling get_share_dir from
  Postgres if PGSHARE is not defined. Configure should define it.

- Regenerated complexenv.png diagram

- Obtain a lock on sl_event_lock during MOVE_SET
  processing in remote_worker.

** 2.1.0 (beta 2)

- Bug #204 :: Upgrade from 2.0.x fails under PostgreSQL 8.3, fixing
              issues with failover and non-direct subscribers

- Bug #205 :: Upgrade fails from 2.0.0, return type from cloneNode changes

- Bug #206 :: Do not perform an accidental rollback in a try block

- Bug #208 :: Fixing issues with bulk adding of tables.

- Bug #209 :: Default table ID problem

- Bug #210 :: merge set should wait for both sets to be subscribed
             before submitting the merge event.

- Bug #211 :: Modify the altperl tools so they don't enclose statements
             that wait for events inside of a 'try' block.

** 2.1.0 (beta 1)

*** Some items without bug numbers:
  - Introduced tests using the clustertest framework, consisting of two
    sets of tests:
    - clustertest/regression - port of the old tests in the tests directory
    - clustertest/disorder - new simulated order entry system with a fair bit of concurrency

  - Configure and Makefile cleanups and improvements, including
    - Configure looks in common locations for some of the DocBook
      tooling, so it is less likely to require manual intervention on
      some common distributions
    - Pick up Groff automagically
    - Script to do virtually all the work documented in the [[http://slony.info/documentation/2.0/releasechecklist.html][Release Checklist]]
  - Documentation updates
    - Reorganized sections
    - Trend towards having version-specific documentation, rather than
      trying to have it document all versions at once
  - Git changes
    - Numerous .gitignore files set up to ignore generated files
  - Add a resetSession function that will reset the session state
    cached in the C stored functions.

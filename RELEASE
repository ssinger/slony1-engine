** Some items without bug numbers:
  - Introduced tests using the clustertest framework, consisting of two
    sets of tests:
    - clustertest/regression - port of the old tests in the tests directory
    - clustertest/disorder - new simulated order entry system with a fair bit of concurrency

  - Configure and Makefile cleanups and improvements, including
    - Configure looks in common locations for some of the DocBook
      tooling, so it is less likely to require manual intervention on
      some common distributions
    - Pick up Groff automagically
    - Script to do virtually all the work documented in the [[http://slony.info/documentation/2.0/releasechecklist.html][Release Checklist]]
  - Documentation updates
    - Reorganized sections
    - Trend towards having version-specific documentation, rather than
      trying to have it document all versions at once
  - Git changes
    - Numerous .gitignore files set up to ignore generated files
  - Add a resetSession function that will reset the session state
    cached in the C stored functions.

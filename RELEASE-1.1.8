- Change to rotatelogs configuration to support older versions of Apache
log rotator

- Fix to altperl "execute script" script to pass the filename properly

- Fix to xxid Makefile: in the 1.1 branch, xxid.v73.sql is still in
use, and should be copied to generate the other versions.

- Fix to src/backend/slony1_funcs.v80.sql - comment on the right function in v8.0

- Fix to src/slonik/slonik.c - it wasn't pulling in the right version of slony1_funcs.?.sql for late breaking versions of PostgreSQL

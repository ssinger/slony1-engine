A number of minor bugs have been dealt with, plus the following more significant changes:

- Added a SYNC slonik command to allow requesting a SYNC event.
  This is a more useful thing to wait for than a SUBSCRIBE SET.

- MERGE SET now refuses to be applied if a subscriber has not
  yet confirmed post-subscription events

- Added a SLEEP slonik command to allow writing code that tells
  the script to pause for some number of seconds

- Fixed a concurrency problem where if you had multiple log
  shipped nodes, the threads processing them shared a single
  file descriptor as well as other variables.
